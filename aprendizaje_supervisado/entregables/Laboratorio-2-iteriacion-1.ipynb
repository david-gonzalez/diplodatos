       "[\"The music track of this version is made up of various romantic symphonies and overtures . At first the effect seems quite pleasing . Then you realize that no attempt has been made to match the mood of the visuals with the music , so you end up with things like a light-hearted scherzo during the first appearance of the vampire , or Dvorak 's `` New World '' symphony over the arrival of the vampire in Bremen . The music track eventually becomes an unbearable distraction and the only thing to do is to hit the mute button .\",\n",
       " 'I gave this to my 4 year and 2 year old grandchildren . They absolutely loved it . We watched it everyday for about 5 days . They got a real kick out of their father joining in and knowing the words and the story . It is definitely a family movie .',\n",

       " \"I 've seen this one lots of times . I believe it to be a true and accurate depiction of the settings and circumstances . Michael Caine does an outstanding job in his role.Even though this is an older film , it still has appeal . Because of the place and time period , no special effects were required to film it . Of all the Zulu films I have seen , including the recent mini series & quot ; Zhaka Zulu & quot ; , I think this one is the best . And for this price , it 's well worth the purchase price .\",\n",
       " \"I purchased all the Inspector Morse DVDs and have watched the episodes over and over again . I 've never found a series I like better . Perhaps it 's because the classically beautiful city of Oxford is not only the physical location for most of the stories , but also an ideal intellectual setting for plots featuring characters engaged in the life of the mind.The first time I heard Morse repeating the last verses of Tennyson 's poem `` Ulysses '' to Chief Superintendent Strange -- '' Tho ' much is taken , much abides ; and tho'We are not now that strength which in old daysMoved earth and heaven , that which we are , we are ... . '' -- I knew I was hooked on Morse for life.I 'm glad PBS decided to produce the Inspector Lewis series with some of the same characters and aesthetics as Morse . While I 've been happy to see Kevin Whately return in his role as Lewis , it 's Detective Sergeant Hathaway who reminds me most of their predecessor , the intriguingly intelligent and brooding Morse.If you enjoy Morse , Lewis , and Hathaway as I do , you might also be interested in a recently published novel by John Rather titled Arius , available at Amazon . It 's an intelligent thriller that begins at the University of Oxford with a murder resulting from the response people have to a controversial viewpoint dating back to the Nicene Council .\",\n",
       " \"I 'm an avid Horror movie goer . My taste in horror flicks may not be the best , I 'll admit I am a little picky , but they still have to be worth watching . This movie has no redeeming qualities to it whatsoever . I watched it with a group of people and by the first five minutes none of us knew what was going on , yet the ending was easily predictable . It was one of the worst horror flicks I 've ever seen . I would n't recommend even renting it .\",\n",

I understand Kilmer as a choice for Morrison but , Meg Ryan as Pam ... only in a dream world.All the dates and many facts were either wrong or excluded . Stone even turned to making things up to fill time and help move the story along . All in all a very good story but , not nearly an accurate depiction of Jims ' rise and fall\",\n",
       " \"I like `` creature '' flicks - even the bad ones - so had high hopes this movie would be at least entertaining . It was n't . Much of the movie makes no sense ( the creature can read minds and yet apparently ca n't ? ) and the rest of it was just a jumble of weird bizarre images that did n't gel . Do yourself a favor - watch Lake Placid and pass on this one .\",\n",
       " \"I was in the mood for a little Lifetime movie last night and this was on . My advice for anyone in that boat : Do n't waste your time on this one . It is a stinker . Lindsay Lohan used to be a cute , kind of fun actress in her younger days , and from watching this , I ca n't even imagine what 's happened to her . This is one ugly film . It does n't make any sense , the acting and writing is drivel at best , the movie is really dark and disgusting with very little redemptive value as to the time spent watching it . I admit , I did n't finish watching it , but I am so glad I had better judgement and turned it off-I watched enough to realize that this movie is just a gross , bad way to spend any amount of time . Some Lifetime movies are mindless entertainment to while a way an hour or two in bliss while eating a few snacks and having tea or whatever , but this one should be avoided as being one of the stupidest movies made-even for the Lifetime network 's standard of movies .\",\n",
       " \"What everyone else has said about this release is true . The sound quality is poor , with considerable background humm/buzz . The picture is squashed and the movie has been edited.One the of my favorite parts of the movie was Chip Davis ' score . Maybe someday a `` real '' , properly formatted , DVD will come out , with at least SOME bonus material . Perhaps Chip can even provide an isolated score for us C.W . McCall and Mannheim Steamroller fans . But this current release is a total piece of junk . It 's only good for those who had n't seen it in years , and then for one viewing only.2010 EDIT : Once I got an LCD screen to replace my old tube-TV , I found it had a few different `` widescreen '' settings . Each of them display the screen stetched to a different ratio . One day I had a thought , what I put in this CONVOY DVD and try the different settings ? Sure enough , one of them compensated for the odd ratio that was one of the many flaws of this release . So , there is a way around that one . But the poor audio and edits all remain , and I wo n't budge on my 1-star overview of this particular relase of the movie .\",\n",

       " \"This DVD is captured in the late 80 's , and features an Eric Burdon Band including Jamie Moses on guitar . The performance is excelent , but there are several reasons to AVOID this DVD:1 . It 's a bootleg , and you will cause Eric econimical harm by buying it.2 . The sound is AWFUL ! You ca n't hear Erics singing , and when you ca n't do that , you miss the whole point of the gig.3 . It 's very short ! Only a 3/4 hour or so.Hopefully , this will talk you out of buying it : - ) And if you want a really good concert DVD with Eric , buy the Live at The Coach House DVD !\",\n",
       " \"Troma makes great movies . However they also usually buy and distribute crap . This is another one of those.I really did n't like Joel Reed 's `` Bloodsucking Freaks '' much . It was hyped to be so extreme and really was n't . It also did n't have much comedy.Well , G.I . Executioner is far tamed from that . It 's a long line of terrible dialogue and the only selling point is nudity . I guess a girl shooting a gun while in the nude and being killed landing in a big net and hanging in the net nude is supposed to be the entertainment highlight of this film .\",\n",
       " \"This review is for the blu-ray version , I had to get it through amazon.ca because they have n't gotten around to a US release yet.The mood set by the pacing , cast , visuals and audio , it is so engrossing ! But my enthusiasm aside , be careful , here are what I consider to be some important considerations when you are preparing to watch it.1 > Watch it ALONE at least once , especially the first time.Also , while we do have a nice home theater system in the living room , I watched this with home theater headphones cranked up to really bring myself into that world.2 > Expectation going in -If you are looking for a movie that spells it out in familiar letters that everyone can see and talk about , you 'll probably be painfully bored.You have to meet this half way , in terms of audience effort its more like a painting than a film . The movie definitely puts you on a suggestive path where the mood , minimal dialogue and situations give plenty of room for your own powers of perception and interpretation to engage , which have hopefully been sharpened by your interests in human nature and history.3 > Energy level and frame of mind -I made the mistake on my first attempt to watch this late at night as a second movie and I had to stop a little less than half way through . So my recommendation is to watch it earlier than later in the night , when you are in one of your more reflective serious moods . And if you are going to indulge in legal intoxicants to 'expand your mind ' , it can enhance the experience , but drink responsibly .\",\n",
       " \"I dont mean to be so negative but I 'm a business person and I dont have the time or energy to send this back and im annoyed .

No tackle discussions , no bait discussion . I am frankly floored this is even being sold . A guide to saltwater fishing should take you through tackle , bait , techiniques , locations , tips . I have 5 other videos of the series and I hope they are produced with education in mind .\",\n",
       " \"I bought this `` collection '' at Sam Goody for $ 19.99 , and it was another waste of money . The first reason is that there are supposed to be 4 DVDS , but apparently someone made an error when they packaged it because there are only 3 DVDS , so the store gave me a discount . The second reason is that there are no special features , what you have to do is select play and then suffer through the F.B.I . warning and then watch the cheesy animated company logo , and the quality is horrendous . But all the episodes have the original opening and closing theme music , even though it said it did n't ! But please do n't waste your money on this horrible `` collection '' . I still ca n't belive that I bought this after one DVD was missing . Go figure !\",\n",

Do n't waste your money .\",\n",

Although I was very much looking forward to watching this movie in the upgraded Blu-ray format , I was extremely disappointed in the picture quality . This Blu-ray version is extremely soft and overly bright , and lacks HD image depth throughout . Bottom line - because there is no noticeable upgrade in picture quality , if you already own MGM 's 2007 release on DVD there is no need to purchase this Blu-ray version . Let 's hope Citizen Kane & Magnificent Ambersons Blu-ray releases will be better !\",\n",

       " \"On the surface `` Precious '' could be another sad movie about tragic circumstances of the poor , uneducated , etc . What I walked away with from the movie was the following:1 ) the complexity of victimization , that in this society in an effort not to resolve the true core issues of our day , we spend all our focus on painstakingly analyzing why the victim is in the circumstances they find themselves and how its their fault . In Precious , we witness the victimization of a young girl , and not till the end do we see the victimization of the mother , and we see nothing of the victimization of the father.2 ) failures of a society , that in a society that does n't spend all its resources in maximally developing its citizenry , but instead creates multiple layers of winners based on categories of class , race , education , wealth and sex - you instead maximize victimization . Obviously a highly victimized society , were any victim can then turn perp , but for the most part does n't turn activist is one that can be better managed and controlled and continually denied basic dignity.3 ) choices , that each and every day we all have the choice to make our lives and the lives of others better from our vantage point . On our job when someone is being targeted , do you have the courage not to join in for fear you will be next . In your relatoinship when it becomes clear that it has taken an unhealthy turn , do you have the courage to seek support and the relationship 's end instead of allowing the robbing of years of your life . As a professional doctor , lawyer , officer , etc . with the special priviliedges you enjoy in this society , your actions can be catastrophic to an individual 's life , do you have the courage to not fall into the trap of feeling that the lives of others do n't count , and therefore do n't warrant your compassion or whatever real and safe assistance at your disposal.4 ) justice , that each and everyone on this planet is deserving and in so believing that all of our resources must be brought to bear in order to bring about peace , justice , and the upliftment of life wherever we find ourselves . That it is not victims that are weak for they have truly survived unimaginable horrors , weakness are in the actions of the perp who neither process the compulsion or imagination to do something other than harming/maiming/raping or killing of others as well as those who simply walk away ( physically or mentally ) when their resources could be of use.Precious was n't simply about the abuse of a young black girl ; it was about the abuse and victimization of all people everywhere . I commend the writers , producers , actors and actresses , etc . having the courage to make this movie and in so doing - make a statement.Now what are we going to do ? ?\",\n",
       " \"I first saw this as a special on the Discovery Network 's Military Channel . I had to wait several months before it became available on Amazon but it was worth the wait to own it . These men 's stories are compelling and fascinating . This dvd should be shown in every civics class in the country ( provided we started HAVING civics classes again ) .The men who trained at Camp Ritchie were almost exclusively European Jewish refugees who had just recently escaped from the Nazis . Yet they all volunteered to return to Europe to serve their newly adopted country.They all took this very seriously but the dvd does make use of the usual humorous soldier stories . Such as the one where two of the Richie Boys who are now with the US Army in a forward area doing POW interrogations complete a fake prisoner interrogation report stating that they have captured Hitler 's latrine orderly and he gave them very detailed information on the fuhrer 's private parts . They sent it to their immediate superiors and they all had a good laugh . Until someone forwarded it to a higher HQ and a Colonel from Washington showed up to meet the latrine orderly for himself ! This is a must for any student of WW II .\",\n",

       " \"I love airplane disaster films , even one as `` bad '' as the TV-movie `` Horror at 37,000 Feet , '' but `` Air Marshal '' is embarrassing ! It is so badly written , badly acted , and badly made , this airplane disaster movie is a DISASTER unto itself . The prologue made no sense and you could n't even connect it to the rest of the movie . The model used for the shots of the plane in flight is so blatantly obvious to be a model , even down to the white-painted centers of the wheels on the landing gear , and it did not look like it was flying , but computer-pasted on a bland sky background . It 's the kind of thing cinema students would make for their cinema class . What really killed it for me were ( 1 ) the plane rolling smoothly on the rough terrain of grass without the landing gear buckling , ( 2 ) for the kid ( a ) to remain unaffected by witnessing the terrorist slit the pilot 's throat , and ( b ) to know how to lower the landing gear , and ( 3 ) for the flight attendant to say and do nothing regarding the kid while all that was going on . So , unless you 're studying bad movies , include it in a `` bad movie '' festival or marathon , or thinking of giving it to the crew of MST3K to watch and make comments , avoid this movie at ALL COSTS ! However , if the story intrigues you , then the best movie to watch is `` Executive Decision '' with Kurt Russell or `` Air Force One '' with Harrison Ford . Actually , I think someone here saw `` Executive Decision , '' and thought to himself , `` I can make that kind of a movie . ''\",\n",

       " \"When Wilson ( Terence Stamp ) , a hard-edged working-class ex-con , gets off the flight from London to Los Angeles , you know that whoever he 's looking for is going to have a tough time . Wilson is after whoever was responsible for the death of his daughter . He goes through people relentlessly and remorselessly until he finally deals with a record producer and drug dealer named Terry Valentine ( Peter Fonda ) and Valentine 's hired protector and partner , Jim Avery ( Barry Newman ) . Along the way he picks up a helper ( Luiz Guzman ) and meets a retired actress ( Lesley Ann Warren ) who makes him look at himself a little , but not for long.This is a first-class movie of revenge and retribution , with smart , sharp dialogue , efficient direction and terrific performances all around , especially by Stamp . He plays an aging professional criminal , tough as they come . Stamp at 60 nails the part . There 's not an ounce of fat on the guy . His eyes stare coldly . When a big , muscular thug tries to eject him from a party at the hillside home of Valentine , Wilson tosses him off the cantilevered pool to his death . When several thugs rough him up in a warehouse , make fun of his age and toss him out into the parking lot , he gets up , walks to his car , takes up a gun and walks right back . Several of the thugs get hurt.Fonda also is very good . He plays Valentine as an amoral , self-delusional Hollywood player who is greedy and spineless . Newman is Fonda 's muscle , and Newman comes across as almost as tough as Stamp.An amusing touch is a couple of flashbacks Wilson has , thinking of his daughter when she was a baby and he was with the mother . The flashbacks are taken from a movie Stamp made in 1967 . This is typical of the clever directing of Soderbergh . He has produced a movie which I hope wo n't be forgotten.The Limey , in my view , is a keeper.The DVD looks just fine\",\n",
       " \"In 1988 , film director Stewart Raffill , released the infamous product placement induced film ; Mac and Me ( the E.T . Rip-off ) . 22 years later , he releases this UNREALISTIC film . first of all , the acting was not very professional . 2nd , the plot makes no sense . and 3 , none of the cast members are famous . I just do n't understand how anybody can come up with such a very dumb film like this , or why movie theaters even bothered to accept this sorry excuse for a motion picture.It is no surprise that most of the videos on youtube received so many negative comments . the trailer was n't very appealing . This movie had very little advertising and promotion . many say that it 's too similar to 'School Gyrls ' . I would n't know because I 've never the movie . I did see standing ovation and was quite sure that the unknown cast members did not know what they were doing . when I saw the movie , others who came to see it left the cinema within minutes of start time . I stayed throughout the whole movie to see if it got any better and ... ..IT DID N'T ! ! ! the one star i gave is exclusively for DaCav5 and their song ; 'The Runway ' . that is the only part of the film THAT WAS ACTUALLY DONE RIGHT . the rest was 100 % poorly done . most of the music was tolerable , but was n't compatible with the dance numbers . The one number that I found to be most outrageously pathetic was the Dream video with the firefighters . I do n't believe that anybody would want to give it a thumbs up . Also , the scene in the retirement home was blatantly UNREALISTIC.Some scenes in the move were also UNREALISTIC . A frog would n't be able to survive in soup that is as hot as 47 degrees Celsius . Also , nobody can train insects to be obedient . And there is a scene when everyone is getting out of the taxi . 20 passengers CAN NOT fit into the backseat of a car . IT 'S IMPOSSIBLE ! ! ! There are more UNREALISTIC scenes , but I 'm only mentioning those that make the least sense.the one scene that made me cringe was the horse race betting scene . the girl just walks into the place and security does n't immediately do anything about it . she even tries to place a bet but is told no because of her age . It surprised me that nobody other than the cashier and the security officer told the girl to leave . I think that the scene was uncalled for and ... ..UNREALISTIC.There WAY are too many things wrong with this movie . The cast did not do a very good job . Despite the epic failure , the cast and crew are still full of excitement . they are way too optimistic in my opinion . Many positive reviews are either from those who were involved in making this movie , or those who are in desperate need for mental help . I would n't recommend it to anybody of any age , PERIOD ! As for the `` Generic '' cast members , I hope they are never seen or heard from in movies again . The privilege to be an actor/actress is a given and none of these cast members have any right to be in a movie.So once again , Stewart Raffill has managed to create another bad movie . only this time , he has made a movie that has the worst opening in all of United States history . the only thing that I 'm glad Standing ovation lacks is excessive product placement.Standing Ovation ? No . it 's more like The 5 Talentless Girls . A movie that is UNREALISTIC.if you desire to watch a movie that is junior high age , I recommend The Diary of a Wimpy Kid , Stand By Me , or Now and Then ( oh how I miss Gabby Hoffman and Christina Ricci ) . If a musical is what you desire a musical , wathc High School Musical ( sure it 's annoying , but at least it 's professionally done and REALISTIC ) .\",\n",

       " \"After giving this movie a bit of thought and and having spoken about it with a university professor friend of mine , who called it `` profound , '' I can not help but think of the deeper , more underlying consequences of this movie and what it is trying to say . I will try to grasp some major points in a nutshell:1 ) Us Welsh would rather be singing than fighting for King and Country any day . Yes , that is subtly portrayed here , but when duty calls , well , we fight.2 ) The Zulus are portrayed as a proud people , who will listen to and obey their leader . ( Here , in this movie , an old man/chief on top of a mountain , basically directing the battle below . ) And they fight bravely most likely to defend their homeland , their dignity , and their self-respect . ( Does that sound like any other battles of which you may have heard ? ) And 3 ) That despite our differences : racial , cultural , spiritual , please name any divisive element , as you well know that humankind can , that human beings can , may , and will transcend their differences , if they are able to unite in song . It sounds rather simple , does n't it ? Or perhaps even a little naive , but , I think , after multiple viewings and thinking about what the message of this movie is really trying to convey , perhaps it is just that : we can unite , we can be brothers , if maybe we could listen to what we each of us have to offer each other . And here in this movie , that message of brotherhood and understanding is conveyed by the medium of song . At least , that is how these `` warriors '' come to a conclusive `` truce , '' that is , at least a cessation of their hostilities ( and then , most likely , a return home to the wife and kids ) . The Welsh regiment stands strong with a rousing version of `` Men of Harlech , '' and the Zulus sing one of their songs , which , I am sorry to say , I can not describe by title.This movie IS British . It does have a message to say . Anti-war ? Yes ! Anti-futility ? Yes ! Pro-song ? A double yes on that one ! There is some fine ensemble acting here . Michael Caine in his first cinematic role ; Welsh actor Stanley Baker looking and acting like a more serious John Cleese ; James Booth as the representative English malcontent , Hook , bitter and caustic on the outside , fighting spirit on the inside ; the late , great character actor , Jack Hawkins , and some other fine ( and non-British ) acting talent . How can one be disappointed with such acting ? And , of course , who else to `` wrap up '' a seemingly , more-or-less , Welsh saga , than to have Richard Burton provide final commentary as epilogue ? And , of course , there is the stunning scenery of South Africa filmed on location . No , it 's not Bala , arguably the most famous lake in Wales , as one Welsh regimental soldier laments , with the ground `` not good enough to hold a man in his grave , '' but nevertheless stunning.And , music by John Barry , too ( of Bond/007 fame ) . Ca n't beat that with a stick.Buy or rent this movie , and you will understand what I mean . Cymru am byth !\",\n",
       " \"Visually and atmospherically , & quot ; Interview With The Vampire & quot ; is a beautiful film and it is great to see that this DVD from Warner Home Video is bringing the film to life like never before . In a direct comparison to the 1997 DVD release of the film - it was one of the first DVDs in the market , actually - it becomes obvious that technology has made big strides . While the image quality of the original release was outstanding at the time , the new transfer exhibits a notably higher definition . Although the master from which this DVD has been created appears to be the same that was used for the DVD release three years ago , the film looks remarkably better on this DVD . The movie is presented in a 16x9 enhanced widescreen presentation in a 1.78:1 widescreen aspect ratio.The color reproduction is more faithful to the film 's original presentation without any signs of discoloration . The level of detail is incredible and edges are sharply defined without the signs of edge-enhancement that were evident in the earlier release . Blacks are deep and always maintain enough detail without breaking up . The highlights are beautifully rendered while contrasts are perfectly balanced , restoring all of Jordan 's ominously dark and atmospheric imagery . Color reproduction is very faithful with strong hues and tones , never bleeding , and free of noise . The compression of the movie is virtually flawless without any signs of compression artifacts in the presentation , leaving all the details , and colors fully intact . Interestingly however , the menus found on this disc , are riddled with compression artifacts like pixelation and banding , which is quite surprising given the overall stellar presentation of the movie itself.The disc contains 5.1 channel Dolby Digital audio tracks in English and French as well as an English DTS audio track . Just as in the video department , Warner Home Video brings out some spectacular quality in the movie 's audio presentation . The Dolby Digital track is beautifully an engaging without the slightest signs of noise or distortion . With its good use of the surrounds , the track exhibits a beautiful spatial integration and flawless imaging . Even the subtlest ambient effects are evident in the presentation , adding to the haunting beauty of the film . A good bass extension adds to the movie 's visceral punch , which helps giving some of the more dramatic action scenes the necessary impact.The DTS track that can be found on the disc is equally impressive and actually manages to outperform the Dolby Digital mix on a number of occasions . The dynamics of the track , the clarity and natural reproduction of the score is simply breathtaking . The spatial integration creates a sound image that is extremely lively and boasts of the most subtle sonic nuances and timbres . Dialogues are well integrated in all versions and always understandable.Director Neil Jordan has also contributed a commentary track to this release , which is very engaging and full of valuable information . Jordan covers a plethora of aspects surrounding the production of the movie . Without notable pauses , Jordan easily coves the entire 2 hours of the movie 's running length and manages to remain interesting , entertaining and informative over the entire course . You will walk away from this commentary with a new-found appreciation for the movie and the people involved . The faithfulness and efforts that went into making this the atmospheric film it ultimately is , is impressive and full of exciting tidbits.When starting up & quot ; Interview With The Vampire & quot ; a 1-minute introduction will greet you , which helps to set the right mood and expectations for the film . The introduction can also be found in the disc 's & quot ; Special Features & quot ; section where you will also find & quot ; In The Shadow Of The Vampire , & quot ; a new 30-minute documentary featuring interesting interviews with Anne rice , director Neil Jordan , Tom Cruise , Brad Pitt , Kirsten Dunst , Antonio Banderas , Stan Winston and many others . Not only does it cover different aspects of the movie and the novels themselves , but also the peripheral area of vampirism in general . It is a great piece that you should n't miss to watch . The disc also contains the movie 's theatrical trailer and a link to a special feature on Warner 's website , called & quot ; History Of The Vampire. & quot ; Warner Home Video has prepared a spectacular package for & quot ; Interview With The Vampire & quot ; with this DVD . Given the quality of all the content it is surprising Warner managed to squeeze four audio tracks in top notch quality on the disc , together with a beautiful anamorphic transfer and even supplements like the documentary . All in all , this DVD turns out to be an incarnation of the movie like you have never experienced it , so do n't miss out on this one .\",\n",

       " \"The two stars are for the Blu-ray , not the film itself , which I love and would happily give 5 stars.Other Blu-ray reviewers have referred to a `` soft '' picture . Actually it is literally *pixelated*.If you take a close look at high-contrast edges , like the names of the actors during the opening title sequence , you can plainly see big blocky pixels that are far too large for 1080p . Based on that , and some occasional frame-blending artifacts , it is clear that the source transfer for this disc was a standard-def telecine ( 60i ) like what would be broadcast on cable networks . The authors of this disc took that old SD master and did an inverse telecine pass to remove the pulldown/interlacing and get a 24p SD master . ( Unfortunately there were a few errors at edit points , causing the aforementioned frame-blending . ) Then it was upscaled to 1080p , but they did n't even do an interpolation algorithm , it 's just nearest-neighbor pixel doubling . Yuck ! I will give it an extra star because ( 1 ) it 's usually very cheap and ( 2 ) it 's way better than the DVD . There are none of the old compression artifacts or edge enhancement here . But for a Blu-ray , it 's very disappointing . It 's barely worth the 8 bucks I spent on it.Also I have to disagree with those who complained about the black levels . The contrast is fine , it 's just that the film itself seems to have been shot in a run-and-gun medium-budget style that did not emphasize rich cinematography . There might be a little bit more range to eke out color-wise from the original film negative , if WB will ever break out the wallet and pay for a new transfer , but I 'm betting there is n't much more depth to be had .\",\n",
       " \"I decided to jot down a few thoughts about this gem of a film after viewing it the other night . I had recalled enjoying it immensely as a child , and this time I was definitely not betrayed by memory ! The story is all about Archy , a plucky and bold yet intensely romantic-souled cockroach/poet , and his good friend Mehitabel the sexy and independent alley cat . You would not think that one could get so involved with animal characters of this sort , but you do , due to the fascinating viewpoints & quasi-human features of the cats , bugs , and rodents who inhabit Shinbone Alley . Although Archy and co. still maintain some basic traits which are representative of their species , they also operate as fable-esque types who satirize many human traits . Mehitabel steals the picture with her sassy , liberated philosophy of life , graceful dancing , and lively singing { her voice is charmingly supplied by Carol Channing } . You can ` t help but love her : she ` s a fetching hybrid of Mae West , Eliza Doolittle , and everyone ` s favorite stray cat . One of the story ` s running plots involves Archy ` s unrequited feelings for her , and you really do find yourself rooting for him : his wistful efforts to help her find a place as a house cat are constantly thwarted by her show biz ambitions and her many boyfriends . Despite some quarrels , the pair remain close , and this makes this the rare animated film to depict the ups and downs of a friendship . Mehitabel and Archy are always there for each other , no matter what the crisis . Highlights of the movie include gorgeous , bright visual depictions of Archy ` s poems , and thesong `` Flotsam and Jetsam '' , in which the pair take a joyous ride down the rivers of New York on a trash can lid . I should add that much of the material is PG in nature , but much of it will also go over a child ` s head { i.e. , Mehitabel ` s covert sexual flirting , a few mild alcohol references } . Also highly recommended : Don Marquis ` witty and touching poems , on which the musical that was adapted into this film was based .\",\n",
       " \"Delectably fantastic is the way I would describe Pixar 's RATATOUILLE ; just the perfect blend of ingredients to make an informative film on the art of cooking that is both savoury and sweet for adults and enough action and cuteness for the kids ( kids that do not get bored easily and have a bit of `` je ne sais quoi '' that is either inborn or taught by some diligent and progressive parents ! ) .Having run a dining facility for nine years now , I found that RATATOUILLE served up a deliciously adult entree of informative cooking tips and cooking terms that we teach at our restaurant.The information about how a kitchen is run and the personel hierarchy is spot-on.We try to always create `` the new '' knowing that the patrons and the critics are always `` on the prowl '' to catch us on an off day ! So , I had NO problems at all with the total enjoyability of this very clever film.I found it far more illuminating than EMERIL and JULIA CHILDS ! The fact that a rat named Remy ( named after Remy Martin I presume ) is the chief-artiste made this rollicking good film all the more delightful.The French accents , the cooking terms , the problem with patrons and critics are all very adult themes , and I saw children around me squirming and laughing occasionally.The adults , though , roared and had a good time and I wondered , '' Did Pixar just trick we adults into seeing a film aimed primarily at us ? '' Well , if they did then it worked for me.I loved every last bite , every last morsel and I belched with approval after the dessert !\",\n",
       " \"BUYERS BEWARE ! ! Any video produced by Alpha is going to be questionable . This DVD produced by this outfit is absolutely horrid . The films jerks and there are points of black outs during scenes in various places . It kept me from otherwise enjoying a fine example of 40 's film noir . The sound varies from clear to distortion at points as well . This would have been a thoroughly enjoyable flicks if they had produced it from a restored master , such as the kind that TCM uses on their network . The movie itself is replete with fine performances , most notably by Edward G. Robinson as a middle aged man trapped in an unhappy married who falls in love with a prostitute played by Joan Bennett . Though I question credibility in his character ... .nobody could be so stupid as to be taken in by this woman unless he was so blinded by love and unhappiness that he failed to see how she was using him . Its a true , haunting portrait of a sad , lonely , frustrated man who becomes Schizophrenic at the end . It is truly a remarkable performance . Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea ( the prostitute and her pimp ) are equally fine in their respective roles . The film is a dark and moody piece but it certainly is in need of a decent film transfer . The DVD here is horrendous . If you can overlook this flaw , you may be able to at least enjoy watching this fine film . Needless to say , other than scene selection , no other extras are included in Alpha 's cheap product which is the reason I give this product ( not the movie ) 2 stars .\",\n",

It has a complex structure which is the interweaving of of three basic sets of characters who are invovled in fixing a fight and trying to recover a stolen diamond . Unlike many comedies it falls outside the normal formulas and the twists and turns of the plot have you in stiches . The DVD is probably better than the film as it is easier to understand the dialogue using the subtitle function . Even Brad Pitt is good .',\n",
       " \"This is an incredible film for the right kind of viewer . It is definitely not for everyone . If you like industry , American history , dark complex characters , action and money , you 'll love it . If you are the kind of viewer who sometimes roots for the bad guy , you 'll love it . This is not a movie for families or people who go to church every Sunday . It is for people who like to see the underbelly of things . We need more of this type of movie in my opinion . Modern movies have become so sugar-coated . I give it an A+ . However , I can totally understand how a lot of people would dislike it . The movie itself is a little threatening and challenging and sinister . Not for everyone , but an incredible film regardless .\",\n",

Maybe in a couple of years they will release the 2-disk collection containing both the DVD version of the original and of this hacked-up tragedy as they did in the UK .',\n",

Animation : graceless , indescript and horrible . Writing : a deplorably plotless mishmash . Characters : voids composed of blank , dunderheaded pixels . Dialogue : stupid , cliched , and at times impossible to follow . I echo too that some of the action scenes -- all of which are sensless and jumbled -- are grotesque and bordering on downright inappropriate . You know when you see a low budget movie and its so tastelee that you are n't sure whether you want to trust it to not make you feel disturbed or disgusted ? Well , this movie gives me that feeling . I hate it when I get through a movie and feel that I just squandered and hour or two of my time here on Earth . It makes me feel guilty and depressed . That 's this disaster in a nutshell .\",\n",

       " \"Shaolin Wooden Men is my most favorite of Jackie Chan 's early films . However , in my opinion the new Columbia/Tristar DVD version is such a terrible print of the film that I regret buying it . The entire upper 60 % of the screen has a horrible pea green cast to it , making everyone look seasick . The contrast has been increased , presumably to 'remove ' scratches , but this has darkened so much of the film that you can no longer see any detail in the woodwork of buildings , the shadows of trees , people 's hair and faces , etc.The worst part is this print is missing over 9 and a half minutes of opening footage that showed Jackie demonstrating the five Kung Fu disciplines used in the movie , as well as his first encounter with the wooden men , the opening overture and introductory scenes of Shaolin life.The one redeeming thing about the Columbia/Tristar DVD version is that it is indeed true letterbox . As such you can truly see the full layout of the film as originally intended . The sound quality is also quite good , considering the age of the film . But despite , this is still the only instance where I 've ever preferred a Beverly Wilshire/Telefilms DVD version of a Jackie Chan film ( fullscreen , scratches , video artifacts and all ) to a remastered Columbia/Tristar DVD version .

Consider Gregory Peck for To kill a mockingbird ( who won with this role ) , Peter O'Toole for Lawrence and Jack Lemmon for Days of wine and roses .To me Peter O'Toole deserved this prize by far but Lemmon even his role was more introspective , tragic and harsh , made the best role of his career playing an alcoholic husband role . Lee Remick was fantastic too , but the sinister moments you watch to Lemmon for instance in the sequence of the garden in the middle of the rain night is simply outstanding .The script is a perfect circle without any hole . A merciless story which typified many couples in the world .A classic and bitter film !\",\n",

       " \"`` Convoy , '' the 1978 action trucker flick , is one of those movies you like but are afraid to admit to . It 's the kind of tape you hide in the closet when friends are over . I first saw this crash epic at the theater as a kid and sat through it a second time because I liked it so much . Time has only slightly worn down my admiration , but in terms of the trucker genre , it 's still the best.Ah , the 1970s , those days of CB handles , Smokey and the Bandit - Special Edition , White Line Fever and Breaker , Breaker . Can you believe we flocked to the theater in droves to see these films ? `` Convoy '' came out at the tail end of this pedal-to-the-metal hoopla , about the time the song `` Movin ' On '' was included on the B-side of all of those K-tel LPs . The film 's director was the one and only Sam Peckinpah , now closing in on the end of a turbulent career . He was suffering from addictions and barely functioning as a professional . Yet even through the haze of alcohol and The Wild Bunch - The Original Director 's Cut ( Two-Disc Special Edition ) dreams , shreds of his wonderful talent can be seen . It 's ironic that a film considered the worst of his career is the best of a genre ( fans of Jonathan Demme 's fine Citizens Band may disagree ) . `` Convoy '' is a muscle epic , with a genuine attempt at portraying the gritty lifestyle of truckers . I like Kris Kristofferson in the lead role , a brooding presence who makes a fine hero . I have always had problems with trucker films because the actors never really seemed appropriate for their roles ( with the exception of Jerry Reed , of course ) . Kris is just right , exuding a sort of blue collar charisma that fits the role like faded jeans and a dirty red bandanna . The supporting cast is unusually excellent , including Ernest Borgnine in fine villainous form , Burt Young , Franklyn Ajaye and Madge Sinclair as salt-of-the-earth truckers , and even a distracted Ali MacGraw jogging around in bell bottoms and mini-fro.The movie , based on the kitschy hit song by C.W . McCall C.W . McCall - Greatest Hits , is about a trucker who runs afoul of a surly cop and then forms a convoy of trucks to escape corruption , jail , whatever . There 's a few subplots , including a governor who wishes to tout trucker rights , a jailbreak somewhere in Texas and eventually a standoff with the National Guard on the Mexican border . It all sounds like a Marty Robbins ' song.The cinematography by Harry Stradling Jr. is extraordinary , taking full advantage of the on-location vistas of New Mexico and Arizona . There 's also a barroom fight and a car crash that must rank as the finest ever put on film . And you even have salty lines of dialog straight from the cynical pen of Peckinpah - `` Mann Act 's for 18 year olds , not someone who 's seen the better side of thirty ! '' Or my favorite , when Kristofferson is asked what 's the purpose of a convoy , `` Purpose of a convoy is to keep movin ' . `` Poor Sam , in the throes of alcoholism , struggled mightily during the making of this movie , and it still performed well at the box office . Never-the-less , his career was in ruins after `` Convoy . '' He would make one more film before riding off into the western sunset . Not many people involved with `` Convoy '' are fond of it due to the problems during production . But what a party it must have been.If you squint your eyes just right and laugh at its absurdity , the wind-blown pages of this mediocre screenplay possess poetry of haunted men chasing ghosts down highways of the American southwest . `` Convoy '' is an example of A-list talent tackling C-list material , the end result being a unique film that raises the level of a crude genre .\",\n",

       " \"Look , going into this you know what you 're getting . It 'll be a pseudo-chick flick in which Jennifer Aniston will be hot ; Gerard Butler will be manly ; the two will be forced to reconcile because of proximity ; and the laughs - as well as the action - will be dwarfed by the attempts to tie everything into a happily ever after bow.Milo Boyd ( Butler ) is a recently fired cop who has taken a job as a bounty hunter . His ex-wife , Nicole Hurley ( Aniston ) , is a pouty journalist who has just skipped a court appearance and jumped bail for a hot story about a potential murder cover-up . Naturally , the paths cross in a soggy Mr. and Mrs. Smith impersonation without the on-screen chemistry . Except Mrs. Smith in this case desperately wants to be with Mr. Smith . And by Mr. Smith I mean Brad Pitt . Hijinks ensue , they reminisce , and yadda yadda yadda.Watch it on an intercontinental flight and at least you 'll pass about two hours .

Interviews with people involved in boxing , including Larry Holmes and Bert Sugar , are interspersed with the scripted 'fake ' parts of this film in an attempt to fool the audience into thinking this is the real deal.However , the actors soon give away the secret ; especially the supposed 16-year old street kid whose good looks , perfect teeth , and obviously scripted stream-of-conciousness dialogue make it apparent that this is not an actual documentary.At the end , as the credits roll , it is finally acknowledged that this is fake.I do n't have a very high opinion of this movie . The fighting is boring , barely visible due to the near-dark conditions under which it was filmed , and unrealistic ( no weight classes and no gloves , just to name two obvious giveaways ) . The dialogue does nothing to enlighten us , only bore us with its banality . In short , the purpose of this movie is to deceive the audience , then shout , `` A-Ha ! ! ! '' at the end .

       " \"I 'm with James Fearn , Oz is the best TV drama ever . So why does this series , with its harsh , violent , brutal characters and unrestrained language and violence rate so high ? Oz is about the two most important issues we all face : sin and redemption . And not sin and redemption in a Catholic or Christian sense , but in the sense of how we all belong to and participate in humanity . To address these issues most directly , the writers ( most of the time , the brilliant Tom Fontana ) and producer ( Barry Levinson ) go to the worst sinners of all and those most in need of redemption , the prisoners ( and their jailers ) at Ozwald State Correctional Facility , a mythical maximum-security prison in New York . Fontana and Levinson have dealt with these issues before , most notably in & quot ; Homicide , & quot ; but this time all the stakes are doubled . In Oz , violence and survival are minute-to-minute issues . So how , in the midst of such violence and brutality , does one find one 's way back to a place in humanity ? Some of the characters struggle to redeem themselves , some get by from day to day , some have just given up , and some go mad , like the chronically depressed and desperate Alvarez.Of these , some even attain true redemption , coming at last to a kind of peace and reconciliation . And then Levinson and Fontana remind us of the true dilemma of redepmtion : it 's just so damn fragile . Some of the most dramatic and heartbreaking moments of all are when we see the best characters , those who have found their fragile peace , descend once again into the violence they ( and we ) thought they had escaped . Because redemption is n't absolute . Like the prisoners and jailers in Oz , it lives moment to moment , and at any time we can lose our grasp on it and fall back into pit . It 's safe to say that no television drama has ever addressed these issues so directly or in such harsh , unremitting terms . Oz should stand as a classic in drama , right along with the works of Shakespeare and the ancient Greeks . Besides , once you start watching it , you just ca n't stop .\",\n",

       " \"DIRTY WORK sets out what it accomplishes and that is to entertain on an uncomplicated low denominator level . Norm MacDonald ( Mitch ) and Arte Lange ( Sam ) -- ( SNL meets MAD TV ) -- are two losers who open up a revenge-for-hire business in order to raise money for Sam 's Dad ( Jack Warden ) who needs a heart transplant . This sets up several gags as people hire these guys for various pranks most of which are hilarious ( shaving the evil `` Beared Lady '' at a carnival sideshow hired by a jilted `` little person '' ) . This leads up to the main plot of an evil real estate developer Cole ( Chris McDonald-HAPPY GILMORE ) who hires the pranksters to do his 'dirty work ' to have a building condemned . Realising , that they may hurt the very people they 're trying to fight for , they must undo their destruction . Norm MacDonald 's SNL persona is evident here as he uses some of his dead-pan , understated schtick he used during his tenure on the show especially when he did the Weekend Update segments ( i.e . `` Note to Self.. '' etc ) . This is helped by the casting of Arte Lange who had his moments on Mad-TV and is now one of Howard Stern 's posse on Stern 's syndicated radio show . Lastly , the movie has some funny cameos to help the plot along ( John Goodman , Chevy Chase , Chris Farley , Gary Coleman and Adam Sandler and Don Rickles ) along with love interest played by Traylor Howard ( who seems to be on a failed TV pilot a few times during a televison season ) as Kathy . Overall , sophomoric and low brow on a very hilarious level . Note : Classic line as Mitch and Sam are in a bar fight .

That 's why I was delighted to learn that it was finally being released on DVD , which meant , obviously , a few extras and surprises that the format affords ( widescreen , theatrical trailers , deleted scenes , etc . ) Boy , was I disappointed . First and foremost , it is NOT in the widescreen format , despite what the packaging says . I repeat , THIS IS NOT IN THE WIDESCREEN FORMAT . This is the pan and scan , or full-screen version , with black bars superimposed over it . I ran the DVD simultaneously with the VHS version , freezing frames and comparing . Call me obsessive , but I had to make sure . It was so obvious . Things at the top and bottom of the screen on the VHS version were covered by the bars on the DVD , while the sides of the screen yielded very little extra , if anything , on this so-called widescreen version . As far as the picture itself , the DVD does produce a better quality of this movie than I 've ever seen before . However , that 's the only plus .

Few films leave me trembling with emotion but also loving all the characters . Timothy Spall 's performance is just TOTALLY beyond explanation . I just loved his line `` That 's life is n't it ? Somebody always has to draw the short straw '' when he was speaking to the young lady with a facial scar . The power behind that line really got me thinking . In the end basically we ALL draw the short straw although we might get there by different means.Brenda Blethyn must 've been an emotional wreck after this film similar to the character she plays . How she kept up constant weeping baffles me . Marianne Jean -Baptiste is just beautiful . What a stunning , multi-talented actress . Claire Rushbrook 's character reminds me of so many characters i knew back in London . Good , honest hearted people , slightly near the edge but then we ALL are near the edge in truth . A more candid look at life could not be put on film but then this is what Mike Leigh excels in . Leigh 's criticised sometimes for making his scenes dismal ( although it 's sunny throughout this one ) and his characters wretched , beyond salvation and to be pitied but far from it . After all what he unearths is the truth that exists in families , the skeletons in the closets . If this film had been done in Hollywood it would never have the same impact . It 's a petty argument indeed but some folk have suggested that Marianne Jean-Baptistes character is too dark skinned for her considered being of mixed parentage . I can tell them otherwise . It CAN occur on rare occasions and i have firsthand proof of this . Genetics is something we still do n't have full control over , thankfully .

       " \"Martin Scorsese 's masterpiece Goodfellas has finally arrived on Special Edition DVD and boy is it about time.Goodfellas is a simple enough story to follow . Henry Hil ( Liotta ) has always wanted to be a gangster . He has since he can ever remember and he gets his start at a young age.Henry starts as a teenager doing erands for all the local wise guys . He works for Pauly ( Sorvino ) who is the bigshot of the guys in town . He likes Henry and loves that the kid loves his work . Also in the business are the smooth Jimmy Conway ( De Niro ) and the ruthless Tommy DeVito ( Pesci ) who go along with Henry on this lifelong journey through the mob.We get to see the highs of Henry like when he marries Karen ( Bracco ) and starts his family . To the lows of the late 1970 's where he finally gets busted big for his involement in drugs.This movie is incredible . Like Coppola did with The Godfather Scorsese pays attention to all the details in this movie . The cast is absolutely flawless . The script is perfect . The sets are all real and authenic as are the costumes . This movie is just incredible.Ray Liotta gives the performance of his carear . He was a perfect cast for Henry Hill . He plays the tragic character to perfection from his happy high points to his cocaine filled sad points . Liotta not getting at least a nomination by the academy for this role is a shame.Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro are awesome in their supporting roles . Pesci won the Oscar for his role as Tommy Devito . He cracked me up in this movie playing the stero typical ultra violent wise guy . It really shows his depth and talent as an actor that he go do a character like Tommy and follow it up with a more family friendly charcter Harry in Home Alone.De Niro does his thing as Jimmy Conway . This guy is great with any charcter that he plays , but when he gets to be a violent mobster that just adds an exclamation point to it . I love his smooth talking and Jimmy is believable . Lorraine Bracco is also good as Karen and she did receive a best actress nomination for the role . All the performances are great in Goodfellas and props should go to everybody . This is one of the few movies that I 've seen that has a perfect cast from the stars to extras.This is Martin Scorese 's best movie . Like Coppola was born to do The Godfather and Spielberg was born to do Schindlers List this is Scorses 's film . Nobody else could have pulled this off . The music the details it 's all here . He should have gotten the Oscar for Best Director . Maybe he will finally get one for THe Aviator which is due later this year.You have to own Goodfellas . The DVD specials with documentaries are great . I loved the commentary from Scorese and Henry Hill . No serious DVD collection or movie collection is complete without this . Deep down inside like Hill I think we 've all wanted to be gangsters at one point . I 'll never be one , but I can experience the mob everytime I watch this . Go get Goodfellas now . You wont regret it .\",\n",

Yawn.Then there 's the fact that there are no extras , no deleted scenes , nothing.And lastly , I was majorly annoyed to be forced to watch four movie ads prior to getting to the menu . You CAN NOT hit Stop , you CAN NOT hit Menu , you CAN NOT hit Pause ... once this DVD is in , you will always , always have to sit through four movie ads before you get to the menu ! `` Action forbidden by disc '' is what you 'll see . Lame ! Keep your old DVD copy . The picture is the same , and that 's what counts . Call me when the real extras edition shows up with interviews , extra scenes , etc .\",\n",
       " \"When the trailers first came out for April Fools Day , they were accompanied by the song & quot ; Momma Told Me Not To Come & quot ; by Three Dog Night . I was n't sure if it was a slasher movie , a comedy , a comedy-slasher movie , or even a frat-party movie . All I knew for sure was that Deborah Foreman ( Valley Girl ) was in it and in the mid-80 's I thought she was so hot you could have cast her in a high school driving safety video and I would have paid admission.Foreman plays Muffy , a rich college kid who invites a bunch of friends to a secluded island owned by her family for a weekend ( an April Fools weekend ) of fun and pranks . The island is only reachable by ferry and this is the last ferry until monday . An accident happens and the kids are shaken . Here is where the mind games start . Not many of the young people know each other . All are supposedly friends of Muffy , but most of them do n't know each other directly . April fools pranks are played non-stop . Dribble glasses , collapsing chairs , and newspaper clippings about dark events . Wait a second ... newspaper clippings ? Is someone playing a joke , or is this real ? There is the hook.Severed heads , rattlenakes , and Muffy 's slow transformation from college beauty to frumpy borderline personality disorder mix evenly with dirty tricks and foolish pranks . What is real ? How much danger is everyone in ? There is no argument that April Fools Day was riding in on the wave of 80 's slasher films , but that is where the similarity to other genre movies ends . You really have to think at this one . They really want to you ask yourself & quot ; is this all a joke ? & quot ; and & quot ; could anyone have actually survived that ? & quot ; I have to give some credit to the music for setting up some great tension . It adds to the feel without taking you out of the moment.If you have not seen this film but you have a friend that has , do n't let them tell you any of it 's dark secrets . Enjoy .\",\n",
       " \"The 90s were an interesting time for the horror genre ; the 90s started off on a down note for horror flicks , while there were plenty of one that were successful it seemed like there were more misses . The days of the franchises were all , but over as they finally ran out of steam and the audience were n't really responding to them as well . The filmmakers who shaped the genre in the 70s and 80s were now falling on tough times . New franchises started and most ended up going direct to video . But than Kevin Williamson came along and bought horror back big time . Like his work or not at one point this guy was the biggest thing in horror and really shook things up . Suddenly well known TV actors were now starring in horror flicks something that was never possible in the 80s and even some well known film stars did horror . While I prefer a cast of unknowns or cult actors , point is Williamson changed a lot in the genre.The Faculty is the typical horror flick from this point in the 90s ; the stylized hey look at us we 're so smart and cool era made famous by Kevin Williamson . At this point in his career Kevin Williamson was red hot . All the screenplays he wrote were huge hits and spawned several knock offs and his TV work like Dawson 's Creek became the latest teen sensation . I 'll confess Kevin Williamson 's movies are sort of guilty pleasures . In particular they are n't my kind of horror , but I do enjoy watching his movies again his flicks are my guilty pleasures . He found a formula that worked and rode it out until the end.The Faculty is a high school version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and there are many references to the Body Snatcher movies and novel as well . I 'm a sucker for the Body Snatcher movies I love them all and no many how many remakes come I 'll watch them . Most people will cite Scream as Williamson 's best work as a writer , but I 'm going with The Faculty . All that made Scream so popular is here , but at times it felt a little forced where as The Faculty it does n't seem so forced . I thought this was well written and with excellent if not clich & eacute ; d characters , which I believe was intentional.Besides Invasion of the Body Snatchers there is also a homage to The Thing as well . If Scream was his homage to slasher flicks , The Faculty was Williamson 's homage to Alien Invasion movies . The characters as stated are clich & eacute ; d , but they work well actually and are all quite likeable . They are well developed and in some ways all add to the plot . Again most people will cite Scream as his best , but I have to go with The Faculty . In a sense all of Williamson 's scripts are almost a rewrite of each other . They all follow the same formula , but they were all mostly well written.Robert Rodriguez is one of my favorite directors and he does an excellent job here . The pacing of the film is very well done . The plot or characters always move forward and honestly there is never really a dull moment . Something is always happening to keep the viewer hooked on the movie . The Faculty does lack the thrills and chills of the Body Snatcher movies , but there is some decent suspense and tension to be found . At this time in horror everything was very Hollywood stylized made for a new crowd and people like me were pretty much left out , but The Faculty is one of the very best from the Williamson era.The Faculty is a slight letdown is the sense I did expect more from Robert Rodriguez in the thrills and chills department , but that is actually the one real fault in the script . Everything is so hip and cool I suppose that is why it gets lost so for me that is the only flaw in the script . But there is some decent suspense and tension at times and probably better than most of these Hollywood horror flicks at the time , but I did expect more from Robert Rodriguez , but regardless he does do an excellent job at keeping the pace moving and always keeps the movie a lot of fun.About my only complaint is in the final act when we find out who the main alien is we see him or her out of human form . I do n't know for me it just did n't work . The saying sometimes what you do n't see is better and in this case I think that 's true . For me the alien out of human form just did n't fully work . But it 's not something that ruins the movie . The Faculty is still enjoyable , but I would have preferred the alien to stay in human form.The Faculty is a product of it 's time . Every element of 90s horror is here though a lot has changed since this type of flick is a thing of the past now . But despite my problem with the movies of this era , The Faculty is in my opinion one of the better flicks from that time . The casting is solid and all the actors provide solid performances . I actually liked all the characters and found myself rooting for them to survive.Who knew this would mark the end of the Kevin Williamson era ? While it may not have lasted long it did revive the horror genre and start a new trend even if what in spawned was mostly lousy with some exceptions . After this , Williamson would fail at the box office as a writer and producer and his TV shows did n't make it out of their first season . Kind of weird how at one moment he 's box office gold and TV ratings gold and the next moment everything is a flop . Overall The Faculty despite being Hollywood stylized is in my opinion a very enjoyable take on Invasion of the Body Snatchers .\",\n",

I have watched it in 1997 and still it remains one of the worst big screen blockbusters I 've ever seen ( although I LOVE to watch blockbusters and sci-fi and actions movies especially ) . The plot is universally known and can fit within 3 lines , the movie is full of tarnished cliches ( slimy octopus-like aliens who I do n't know how can operate their flying sources , brave and courageous pilots and soldiers in general , but usually unhappy in family life or & quot ; whose wife is just to give birth to a baby & quot ; , a very cute and young President with a dying old wife ) and cheep pathos and sickly sweet patriotism . The famouse scene of a giant UFO demolishing the White House and surroundings is good , but when Mr President is informed that several million people perished and he even does not blank a tear ... I think you missed a good scene here . It is also a pity to watch good actors performing in such rubbish ( got some good dough though , no doubt ) .The theme of aliens conquering Earth and after initial success receive a good kick in the a ... . from humans is eternal and it raises our self-esteem , but I 'd like to ask the guys making these movies - respect the audience , not all of us have such bad taste or no taste at all or are kids under 12 . One of my friends , an American , said : & quot ; When watching this movie , during first hour I was proud that I 'm American , after it finished - I was ashamed that we 've produced such a movie ... & quot ; However , I would advise everyone to watch it and decide for him/herself and see .\",\n",

Bloodrayne marks Boll 's third video game to film adaptation , and like the ones before it ( House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark ) Bloodrayne is so bad that you have to see it to believe it . Kristanna Loken , best known for being hot and playing the TX in Terminator 3 , stars as the vampire heroine in this incoherent mess , which for some odd reason also features Oscar winner Ben Kingsley as the evil Kagan . The plot is the typical humans VS vamps deal , but the single most intriguing aspect of Bloodrayne is just how did Boll manage to get these actors in this film ? It 's mind boggling how Kinglsey , Michael Madsen , Michelle Rodriguez , and Billy Zane all ended up in this , all of which spewing some of the most terrible dialogue you 'll ever hear . Occasionally the action and gore are decent enough , but Bloodrayne is best enjoyed as an unintentional comedy .

The Caveman is simply there for comic relief , and he fills those shoes ( or should I say furry little slippers ) nicely .

How refreshing , too , that although this is a story about the redemptive power of love it never degenerates into mawkishness ; and although the situations it puts them in are faintly ludicrous , the characters are painfully real . This is such a pleasant change for romantic comedy and , amazingly , it 's Adam Sandler who holds it all together . It 's an inspired piece of casting because Sandler brings with him all the baggage of his previous on-screen inanity - he has your expectations heading in one direction while writer/director Anderson 's clever little screenplay quietly takes you in another .

Matt Damon is just a bit young for Jason Bourne , but he was fine . The whole premise is either A ) completely unbelievable or B ) absolutely fascinating -- take your pick . It 's just a movie , so I 'll take B .

Like Alex , he 's got his own aesthetic angle on violence . . .and the world 's got a thing or two to teach him.Kubrick is n't making a movie & quot ; about war & quot ; . He 's making a movie about men & quot ; watching a war & quot ; -- check the extraordinary sequence mid-way through where a film crew improvises a human chain to produce a smooth pan shot for newsreel footage.Some reviewers do n't care for the Parris island/Vietnam segue . . .I think its brilliant . Parris Island is confined , claustrophobic , weirdly homerotic , and savage in its own remarkably nasty way . Vietnam is savage in a very different , but also remarkably nasty way -- note in particular how Kubrick switches from the all male world of training , to place women directly at the center of warfare in 'Nam . With a filmmaker this calculating , you can be sure that there 's a reason the sniper 's a girl . . .Finally , see this movie for the best City/ & quot ; Into the Bush & quot ; transition since Peter O'Tooole went from Officer 's Club to the Desert in Lawrence of Arabia .

I love it that just about everyone on this DVD signs every word they speak . The host signs as a background voice translates for the viewer . This way you pick up more words as you watch the lessons over and over ; you also get to see people interacting in sign language , putting it all together , instead of just learning a bunch of signs . Everyone signs at normal signing speed , so at first it is overwhelming . But as I have watched the program over and over , I can now pick out a lot of what they are signing . I only noticed two drawbacks of this program . One , the speed at which they sign the signs they are teaching you . I had to rewind a few times for the more complex ones . Two , during a couple of the skits the person & quot ; learning & quot ; signs from the deaf person did n't sign the exact same way . They did it backwards or with a different hand .

You will want to retrieve you favorite 3-D specs and watch it in a dark room.Fraser , Hutcherson , and Briem give stellar performances with the Weiss , Flackett , and Levin screenplay that follows Jules Vern 's original novel .

We see diamonds galore in volcano tubes , luminescent birds , hungry sea monsters , floating rocks , and even a crazed T-Rex . 3-D adds to this excitement . ( One hopes that these moviemakers will indeed make a sequel- hinted about Atlantis- in the final scene ) .With no foul , or even curt , language and a short flirtive , but not suggestive , romance this action packed flick is the best movie of 2008 .

       " \"This series adapts the six lengthy `` Palliser '' novels by Anthony Trollope into 26 episodes of delight and intrigue in Victorian England . Susan Hampshire 's Lady Glencora is without doubt the center of this series . Forced into a marriage with the wealthy but distracted Plantagenet Palliser , who seems far more interested in becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer than in his marriage , Lady Glencora must balance her relationship with her husband against that with another man , whom she has truly loved . Watching as the two Pallisers adjust their relationship to find their love is an absolute delight . But this story is more than just the Pallisers . As the six lengthy novels are boiled down to 26 episodes ( 8 in the first set ) , we meet Phineas Finn , an Irish MP who is the title character of two of the books -- one deemed a fine political novel , the other a suspenseful masterpiece . Both are well incorporated into the series . Barbara Murray amazes as Madame Max Goesler , a wealthy widow who interacts with the aristocratic Pallisers without ever letting her great good sense be overwhelmed by the privilege of associating with the creme de la creme . Six novels boiled into a series requires a great ensemble cast , and one is provided . Such noted British TV actors as Derek Jacobi ( later of I , Claudius ) and Penelope Keith ( of To the Manor Born ) play small but important parts as the foppish Lord Fawn and his sister . But in the final analysis , it all comes back to the relationship between Hampshire 's Lady Glencora and Philip Latham 's Plantagenet . Well worth watching .\",\n",

The program shows a pair of giant pandas mating . They also show a successful birth to a baby giant panda cub . The program also shows footage of the rare red panda and a bamboo rat mother and her babies who also eat bamboo . I particularly enjoyed the footage of a salamander that can grow to six feet in length . It lives in the streams of the area . It was very short but very interesting . I highly recommend this program .',\n",
       " \"In my view this is one of the greatest films ever made . I tink it is the best of the trilogy and can not be missed . Everyone has seen it at least once in their lives and everyone I know that has seen it thought it was amazing . The film itself is just an unbelievable mixture of everything you can think of . Chris Lloyd plays the & quot ; mad scientist & quot ; and does it with enthusiasm and great character . While Mike J Fox plays the main character & quot ; Marty & quot ; who is forced to go back in time to escape the people who killed his friend & quot ; The Doc & quot ; . It might not appeal to some but it has a great story and will keep you watching for the whole movie . Robert Zemeckis did an amazing job of bringing this film to where it is now with some of the best special effects in the 80 's . I 'm sure it will be a stunning DVD conversion and a must buy for any Back To The Future fans .\",\n",

       " \"Steven Spielberg 's first cinematic attempt to delve deeper than escapism produced a rich , heartfelt epic that matched the Pulitzer Prize-winning credentials of Alice Walker 's novel , receiving 11 Oscar nominations but famously winning none of them . The Color Purple is a triumph of all elements of production design , nominated for its screenplay , cinematography , makeup , costumes , art direction , score , and three of its actresses - though not for director Spielberg . The snub may have helped push him as an artist toward such prestigious works as Schindler 's List . One would hardly guess Whoopi Goldberg 's roots were in comedy , given the layered dramatic performance she offers in her first real screen role . Oprah Winfrey ( also debuting ) and Margaret Avery are the other two-thirds of the heart-breaking dynamic between three black women in Spielberg 's brutal world of racial and sexual prejudice . Even Danny Glover 's role shows late-blooming sympathy , however agonizingly wrought , which demonstrates the dimension of Menno Meyjes ' script . There 's nothing simple about this early 20th century South , populated by characters paralyzed by the roles ascribed to them , and wickedly punished when they try to venture beyond their bounds . It boils the blood at the same time that it touches the soul , making for genuinely tear-soaked cinema with a visceral emotional payoff .\",\n",

       " \"The Sea Hawk is the one film that I saw as a kid and could not stop watching from start to finish . With breathtaking action , great acting , and a plot line that takes you all over the world [ from England to South America and back ] The Sea Hawk is one movie that you should see if you want to know what a real pirate movie is all about.Errol Flynn stars as Captain Thorpe , a privateer who robs Spanish ships at the time when England and Spain were at war hundreds of years ago . After a great sea battle in the beginning of the moive [ Yes there are guns , sword fights , and cannon fire galore ! ] Thorpe and his men sail back to England with their captured treasure as well as the Spanish ambassador who was sailing toward England to talk with Queen Elizabeth.Joining the ambassador is his daughter Olivia [ played by Brenda Marshall ] who eventually [ or should I say inevitably ? ] falls in love with Thorpe after several romantic scenes in a rose garden as well on Thorpe 's ship , The Albatross.The Sea Hawks are a group of privateers who rob pirate ships as well as Spanish ships in the name of the Queen as well as England . The ambassador is not too pleased with the way he was captured and treated by the men , but the Queen secretly applauds Thorpe for making him look like a fool in front of her.Thorpe is soon sent on a mission to the isthmus of Panama to steal a great amount of gold that is shipped by Spanish troops by caravan to suport Spain 's vast amount of wealth in the war . Being very poor compared to Spain , England 's only hope it seems is to steal the gold and use it for itself in the war . The Albatross along with Thrope and his crew set sail to steal the gold.I wo n't spoil the movie for you , but I will say that a great battle for the gold caravan takes place as well as other great storylines that involve treason , betrayal , and retribution . One involves a secret plot that is revealed involving a massive armada of Spanish ships that will attack England , and also a great sword fight near the end of the movie.This is the movie that started the great chain of Pirate movies for new generations to see . But it is really nice to go back and watch some of the early ones . Sure the special effects are n't as good but the acting is terrific and there are plenty of great action scenes.Extras include : Flynn In Action - A showing of Flynn behind the scenesSubtitlesAnd a newsreel on the movie called `` Warner Night at the Movies - 1940 '' This DVd is highly recommended\",\n",

Unfortunately , the producers of the DVD version of the movie really did n't know what they were doing on the audio track which is mono and seems to suffer from severe compression and distortion effects . The effect is that the sound track sounds muffled and occasionally even drops out altogether . Unfortunately , the audio quality is so bad that it really ruins the movie , and ultimately makes one want to fast-forward through Wilhelmenia Fern & aacute ; ndez 's beautiful singing .

Throw in the France of Louis XVI just before the revolution and you 've got the setting for this totally screwball comedy.Bud Yorkin & Norman Lear ( of All in the Family ) directed and produced and added a cast of the best English comedians to their two stars , Sutherland & Wilder . This includes : Hugh Griffith as the befuddled King ; Billie Whitelaw as a randy Marie Antoinette ; Victor Spinetti as the reptilian Count Escargot ; Jack MacGowran as the seedy Revolutionary amongst others . Oh , and Ewa Aulin ( she played Candy ) is delicious.When Gene Wilder goes nuts , no one can match him for hilarity . As the arrogant , pigheaded , lightning-tempered Corsican nobleman he is just simply wonderful . Sutherland 's foppish brother is a perfect counterpoint.There is so much good stuff in this that one could go on at length ( the Ball with everyone passing notes of intrigue and the King in his chicken costume is just one ) . Suffice it to say , they threw in the kitchensink with one-liners , references to Dumas and every kind of swashbuckler , non-sequiters , puns etc.A crazy madcap just-for-fun all-out comedy .

I get the `` I 'm 30 and I 'm behind in my life because I put everything on hold for a guy '' thing , but she seemed like she was trying to be some intense young 20-something . I really wanted her to act her age , which was unfortunate because all that eye make-up just made her look like she was 40 years old . Now , I like Drew Barrymore and have enjoyed many of her movies . But she and Justin Long really seemed like they were in two different age groups . The chemistry between them was forced and the desperation of a long-distance relationship just was n't very convincing . Justin Long was I think a good fit for this role , but I do n't think the character development was complete . He did seem to be just coasting along while Drew was overdoing it , but again I think he was held back by the poor chemistry with his co-star . I have seen him do terrific work in other movies ( 'Dreamland ' and 'He 's Just Not That Into You ' are excellent examples ) , but this movie just had numerous issues all around.I felt that this movie was trying to be funny in the manner of 'There 's Something About Mary ' or '40-Year Old Virgin , ' but it just was n't . The attempts at gross humor ( especially all that swearing ) were misplaced and forced and took away from the sweetness of the story . Christina Applegate was just plain mean , and men in general were portrayed as idiots . The one bright spot in the movie was seeing an excellent band , The Boxer Rebellion , which we see playing on stage at a club in San Fran.This could have been a really good story in different hands and with a different cast .

This movie was inspiring but it was humorous as well with the cartoon depictions . Joe was truly on a mission to regain his health and he did it . The world should be proud of him . The sad thing about this film was that as he traveled across America and interviewed dozens of people regarding their eating habits , about 80 % if not more just did n't seem to care . The majority knew that their eating habits were bad and needed improvement but at the end of the day , it did n't seem as if enough people were really willing to change . I admire the one guy Phil who called Joe after he had already left America and asked for Joe 's help . Joe actually got back on a plane and returned to the States to help this man ! Nothing could have been more touching . It was awesome to see how he turned his life around and became a new person as did a few others in the film . I am inspired to change my eating habits as well . Let 's face it world . We are what we eat and like it or not we are responsible for about 70 % of our health by what we put in our mouths . The quality of life and great health should not surpass the bad stuff that tastes so good . We must ask ourselves is it really worth it in the end . Yes , I agree that most people who refuse to give up junk food and fast food always say that they are going to die of something so why not die happy ? My theory is what if your life is prolonged and you grow old with all types of health problems and are in and out of hospitals and nursing homes because of what you put in your mouth today ? Who wants long drawn out illnesses that could have been prevented by healthier eating choices ? Hmmmmm ... .makes you think !\",\n",

The foul langauge is minimal.It is also THE BEST FILM for showing life and aircraft operations aboard a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.The cast ( stars Kirk Douglas , Martin Sheen , Charles Durning and James Farentino ) are excellent , and play well off of each other.The plot , which focuses on the Nimitz being time-warpped back to the day before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour is an excellent concept ... especially for the late 1970 's , when the movie was filmed.The big issue among the main players is whether or not to interefere with the course of history ... should they destroy the Japanese fleet - or let history take its course ? If you have not seen the flim - I will not give anything away.However , the real `` star '' of the film is the U.S.S . Nimitz ... and her `` airwing '' consisting of the fighters-attack and other assorted combat warplanes . The markings on the aircraft were without question the coolest-looking of any `` carrier air wing '' at that time or since then . This is especially true of the F-14 Tomcat squadron `` VF-84 Jolly Rogers '' ( with the skull & cross-bones markings ) .You get to see ALL of the aircraft up-close and in great detail . You also get to see great footage of the crew preparing the planes for combat and launching off the deck.You get to see flight-deck operations up close like no other movie ... and far more realistic than seen in `` Top Gun '' ( which was more `` Hollywood '' -style entertainment ) . The fictional fight between two F-14s and two Japanese Zeros in Final Countdown was more realistic than the bigh fight at the end of `` Top Gun '' ! I bet a lot of teenage boys joined the Navy after seeing this film when shown in theatres in 1980 ! Some people believe `` Final Countdown '' is a new-take on `` Philadelphia Experiment '' ... about the World War II attempt by the U.S Navy to make ships invisible ... and resulted in a horrible mishap to sailors onboard the ship.Final Countdown has some plot holes ... and could 've spent more time on debating whether or not to change the course of history . But this may have been done because of time constraints.If you have never seen `` Final Countdown '' , I promise you will find it highly entertaining ... and even thought-provoking ! P.S . The new Blu-Ray disc has several never-before seen extras ... including an interview with the VF-84 Jolly Rogers F-14 Fighter squadron . This alone may make buying `` Final Countdown '' worth the price ! !\",\n",

It depicts the struggle between good and evil , light vs. darkness and how they are forever intertwined . This battle takes place during the Depression with its focus on the inner workings of a traveling carnival.Disc One features an audio commentary on `` Milfay '' by director Rodrigo Garcia , series creator Daniel Knauf and executive producer Howard Klein . This is a very informative track with all the participants making some good observations.There is also an audio commentary on `` After the Ball is Over '' by director Jeremy Podeswa , Klein and Knauf . They talk about the casting of certain characters with people who looked like they came from that time period.Disc Five features an audio commentary on `` Hot and Bothered '' by Podeswa , Klein and Knauf . They talk about the look of the show . One quickly gets the feeling that they started running out of things to say by this track judging by the lengthy lulls between comments.The final disc has a Making Of featurette . Knauf felt that the inner workings of a carnival had never been dramatized before . The cast and crew talk about their characters and the themes of the show.Ultimately , Carnivale poses a lot of questions . How did Ben and Justin get their powers and why them ? How does Ben 's fevered dreams of a man fighting in the bloody , dirty trenches of World War I figure in his past and that of the mysterious owner of the carnival whom we never see ( and might not even be human ) ? By the end of the season there are precious few answers but some tantalizing clues that will hopefully be explored in more detail in the upcoming season .\",\n",

Like many others , I saw _Run Lola Run_ first , and liked it very much . This film had more character development and seems to be a more introspective and philosophical than Lola . Potente carries the film with her portrayal of a sanitorium nurse , Sissi . She is a strong lead and can show a great range of emotions .

Or consider that barrels of oil or gasoline , or tubes of molten metal or liquid nitrogen are conveniently ubiquitous so characters can shoot them when needed to make an explosion or melt some machine.The movie is riddled with such devices .

This may have the workings of a new drinking game - anyone remember `` Hi Bob '' ? Anyway , BUY THIS DVD , even if you do n't love this film , you 'll LOVE this DVD ! Thanks Arnold & John , ... YOU GUYS RULE !\",\n",
       " \"The movie was nothing short of horrible ! Having read all of the books and being a huge fan of the Chronicles , this movie just annoyed me . I swear to you , if it had a plot I need some help finding it ! This movie demonstrates what Hollywood usually does , turns a great novel into a gothic-gore-fest . I mean it reached a point where they were just taking a woman 's work , her life 's devotion , and destroying it under the guise of her characters ! And to the person who mentioned Armand - boy do I know where you 're coming from ( same thing with Lestat ) . I will say this , I actually thought that Aaliah did a good job with the script she was given . She was very convincing as the character the producers created . Interview with the Vampire was a great film that did justice to Anne Rice 's work . The entire cast ( especially Cruise , Pitt , and Dunst ) was terrific . With that being said , here 's something I found hilarious - apparently the main producer of Queen of the Damned wishes that he had been given the opportunity to work on 'Interview ! ' Apparently the film did n't live up to his expectations and he could of done so much more with it . I think I speak for most people when I say that I 'm glad that he was kept the hell of way from that film . At least there is one movie that Anne Rice fans can admire .\",\n",

       " \"After looking at all the great reviews this DVD has received , I added it to my 2-year-old 's wishlist , and she got it as a Christmas gift . She loves watching videos and loves the alphabet , so I thought it would be perfect for her . Well , it may be very effective , but it is SO boring , she can barely sit through 2 minutes of it . ( She can make it through full-length Disney movies , unfortunately , so this has nothing to do with her attention span . ) The program consists solely of repetition - animated letters move across the screen as an unseen narrator drones `` A ... A ... A ... '' It 's really painful , and not fun or thought-provoking at all . It 's much more like brainwashing than teaching.If your only goal is for your child to learn the alphabet quickly , this product will probably suit your needs . If you want your child to become a thoughtful , intelligent , well-rounded individual , play with an alphabet puzzle with him , sing the alphabet song , look at books together , and watch something interesting like Sesame Street . My daughter has learned a lot more from Sesame Street 's All-Star Alphabet . Let 's face it - it 's impossible to learn anything from a DVD that never comes out of its box.I gave this DVD two stars instead of one ( or zero ) because if your goals are different than ours , or perhaps if your child is younger , it may be okay for you . It certainly does not meet the needs of our family .\",\n",
       " \"Although not true to the original book series , Dean Martin personified Cool as Matt Helm . In every scene Martin looks relaxed and natural , and while Bond may have invented the clever quip , the Helm movies honed them to a fine art.The box set is a must-have for anyone who remembers these films fondly or wants to complete their collection of 60 's spy memorobilia . While I wish there could have been lots of extras and behind the scenes , these films come from an era where Hollywood was not quite as ready to let you glimpse behind the curtain so there is little archival material available , and all of the principle actors are deceased making commentary impossible . They are represented well , however , in these excellent transfers . The clear sound and precise letterbox picture with fantastic color and clarity leave behind any previous broadcast . While The Silencers and Murderer 's Row are unquestionably the strongest entries , there are great momements to be found in The Ambushers and particularly the little-scene Wrecking Crew , which was Sharon Tate 's last film . Get this collection and dissappear for a few hours into the world of Comic Book spies where everything is in Brilliant Color , the girls are always elegantly coiffed , the cars had chrome and Dean Martin as gadget toting , hard drinking and smoking Matt Helm suavely saves the day .\",\n",
       " \"The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix ( JCVD-RM ) 1.Who is he ? He 's two guys ! Identical twins separated at birth by the Chinese mafia , one , Chad , is a silk underwear-wearing pretty boy from Los Angeles , and the other , Alex , is a criminal from Hong Kong . Amazingly , they both grew up to be martial arts experts.2.Which family member/friend must be avenged ? Their parents are murdered by the same Chinese mafia3.Does he take his shirt off ? Bolo Yeung rips Chad 's shirt off during a fight sequence4.Does he have sex with a C-List actress ? Yes . Actually , his sex scene with the beautiful Alonna Shaw is worthy of late-night skinemax fame.5.Is there a tournament ? Sadly , no.6.Is training needed for this tournament ? Perhaps some firearms training should have taken place , but aside from that , no.7.Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament ? When teaching/training a class for aerobics , or something , he dons some spandex and displays the goods for the ladies . He tells them that the splits are easy because of his big legs and karate.8.Does he punch someone in the balls ? Yes , Chad jab-kicked Bolo Yeung in the jewels during the final fight - which was clearly revenge for the nut-chop Bolo delivered to Chad 's family jewels earlier in the movie.9.Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks ? Let 's just say that he can use the marks on Bolo Yeung 's jawline for his next boot fitting10.Is his enemy unbeatable ? It 's Peter Malota and Bolo Yeung . Plus , Bolo has a glass eye , and a career record of 0-1 previous to this movie . So , challenging ? Yes . Unbeatable ? Probably not.11.Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance ? Not only does he have to battle Peter Malota , Bolo Yeung , Cory Everson , and poor night-vision , but during one fight scene Donkey Kong apparently begins to throw barrels at Chad.12.Does he win ? Without the help of electricity , I have no doubt Bolo Yeung would have won . However , JCVDx2 manages to avenge their parents and claim their stole inheritance by taking down the entire Chinese syndicate.So , this one goes slightly outside the typical JCVD flick , but the overall impression is positive . In spite of himself , he actually portrays a bad guy or a hardened criminal fairly well . I especially appreciated perhaps the best snot-rocket scene in cinema history - the lighting is stupendous . Ignoring the whole JCVD angle , this one is actually a decent movie with some rather funny dialogue with several gratuitous F-bombs .\",\n",

       " \"Aarrgghh ! The jacket of `` Cross Bones '' depicts a promising panoramic scene of nautical siege involving a full-masted pirate ship beneath an impressive turbaned skull with eye patch . This scene unaccountably does not appear in the movie . What is offered are a few boring minutes of half-hearted swashbuckling amongst the pirate mateys aboard a remarkably spic-and-span `` pirate ship '' -- a suspiciously anachronistic trawler bearing no gun ports and possessing limited deck area for swashbuckling . Red Bones , the fearsome pirate chief , grimaces through his moderate vocabulary as if motivated by heart-burn , throwing in an occasional `` Aarrgghh ! '' -- presumably for the pirate effect , or possibly just belching . In his cannibalistic reincarnation ( terrifying curse ) , Bones achieves new heights , raising his performance level to that of having a bowel movement . When the `` incredible treasure '' is finally unearthed , the delusion is scuttled by a spectacle of garage-sale items . The plot -- movies should have plots -- concerns the filming of a reality show in which the participants spend most of their time spouting senseless bilgewater that leaves one praying for the violent death of the script writer . The only recent movie that degenerates to a category of comparable depths is Asylum Pictures ' `` War of the Worlds '' ( actually , any Asylum Pictures production would suffice ) in which the film jacket promises entertainment and delivers indigestion . Rating of one star indicates one star too many .\",\n",

       " \"This is a movie of redemption . Well ... perhaps not in the way you think . This is supposedly Eastwood 's last movie as far as acting , or so I 've heard . He plays a retired auto worker who 's bitter at the world a.k.a . Hollywood 's latest attempt at portraying the Grumpy Old Man , but this time it 's nothing to laugh at . Here you have a man who fought in Korea , and is prejudiced against all Asians . He for the most part does n't have anything nice to say about anyone . This all changes one night when his prized possession a 1972 Gran Torino is almost stolen by a teenage Asian boy as a initiation to join a gang . Well it backfires , and the boy is almost killed by Walt ( Eastwood 's character ) . It 's at this point that Walt 's and the boy Tao 's paths cross as Tao 's family makes him go over to apologize to Walt , and offers Tao to help out Walt . Walt 's heart is softened somewhat , and he becomes friendly with Tao 's family , and breaks bread with them . He also protects them well the big sister as the gangs in Detroit where Walt lives take a shine to her ... .Not . Anyway Walt takes Tao under his wing ( In his own way ) , and helps him to come out of his shell . Then the real test comes when Tao 's sister is assaulted , and Walt takes matters into his own hands so to speak . Surprisingly he does it up as a way to pay back the Asians he murdered in war while in Korea . He goes out , and gets a fitted suit , makes amendments to his will , and does something his dead wife wanted him to do , and that was to make confession of all his sins . He confronts the teenage Asians with the assumption to kill them all , but imagine that he allows the gang to kill him . This is redemption in action which is how I guess some men try to make amends for not showing love to one another because of male pride , and so forth . Tao in fact gets the closest to an apology from Walt as Tao assumes that he 's going along with Walt to confront the gang , and Walt tells Tao that he ( Walt ) has blood on his hands , and that he does n't want that for Tao . Not to mention that to the surprise of his family ... especially his eldest granddaughter that the Gran Torino goes to Tao . This was a decent outing for Eastwood , but not quite the classics of `` Play Misty For Me '' , or `` Heartbreak Ridge '' . This movie did speak to me however as the scene where Tao goes into the barber shop with Walt , and Walt starts spewing slurs left and right , and then Tao trying to emulate Walt does the same thing , but ends up insulting the guy . This is where we as men have to be careful because we as children want to be modeled after our fathers . I know that one time I heard my father slur a race , and when I said something similar I was told to : '' Shut Up . '' I still do n't understand if he did n't want me to utter the slur then why did he do it in front of me ? This is not a movie for those who are offended by racial slurs , and downright raunchy language . However , Eastwood should 've recieved the Best Actor award for his portrayal of Walt .\",\n",

It 's odd how some scenes were spellbindingly professional and then suddenly , it was low quality acting . Would I watch this again ?

       " \"Loosely based on the book ( which my son also loved ) . The main character is about 12 and moves at the begining of the movie . He encounters a bully on the first day of school who hides worms in his lunch box . This later escalates into a bet that he can eat 10 worms in one day . A hilarious Saturday is spent with a group of 8-10 boys collecting & cooking worms while being kicked out of various parks , homes , etc . The movie ends with everyone being friends.Most of the humor is of the sort that appeals to boys of this age but I laughed too . Secondary story lines involve the little brother ( around 4 ) , a neighborhood girl ( who is teased about her height ) , and dad 's new job . The group of boys includes all types ( athletes , computer geeks , shy , outgoing , etc . ) so it is nice to see them working together.The DVD has a good behind the scenes documentary that interviews the child actors , the guy who made the fake worms , the special effects people that `` microwaved '' a worm , etc .

       " \"Most Blu-Rays are either great ( The Road Warrior ) or terrible ( The Ninth Gate ) , so it 's rare when I find one that underperforms juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust a little bit ; even a Blu-Ray with virtually NO special features has a magnificent picture ( The Dark Knight ) or some other compensation.POLTERGEIST is one of these.The transfer is great . I was 2 when it came out so I never got to see it as a big-screen experience and it is a revelation to see it as such : I liked this movie before and I LOVE it now . However , the transfer 's not the problem ... it 's the master . I do n't think they cleaned the film sufficiently when they struck the master because there 's noticeable dirt and pinprick abrasions throughout the film : it 's not terrible , or even plain bad ... but if you are a videophile like me , it can be a bit unnerving . The worst part is the living room scene where they first speak to Carol Anne : there 's a series of faded vertical scratches through the middle of the screen throughout the entire scene ... I would have hoped they 'd notice that and paint it out , but they did n't . Thankfully the scratches are thin and faint ( and they do n't show up again ) so they 're not unbearable , but they are irritating . The film is grainy , but in the good way ( 1980s film stock was n't as sharp as it is today ) although some grains seem a little larger than others at times ... but I ca n't prove it.As for special features , well , I think POLTERGEIST is never gon na have the special features it deserves due to the whole Spielberg/Hooper controversy , so I wo n't get my hopes up . Basically the picture reminds me of first generation DVDs of classic movies ( the first Road Warrior DVD comes to mind ) ... much better than VHS , but it could be improved/cleaned up.Colors , tones , blacks and all that other stuff seem to be fine . Aside from the maintenance issue , I do n't see any other problems with this transfer and at $ 20 right now is a great find .\",\n",

The story is also amazing , a fantasy that takes place in ancient Persia , war , political intrigue and all that fun stuff .

Ray is a maestro of mediocrity , a Caligari of crap , a sorcerer of ... well , okay , you get the idea . In any case , anecdotal evidence has it that Ray had a couple of unrelated film clips of John Carradine and Cameron Mitchell , and dared screenwriter Brad Linaweaver ( The Brain Leeches ) to come up with a story that used them both . This was the result . Patrick Moran ( Vampire Trailer Park ) was brought in to do a bit of script doctoring , and roped in his pal Steve Latshaw , who 'd also directed VTP . The end result is ... well . Um.So , yeah , sorcerer dies back in the day and curses the town , blah blah blah , then he rises again on Halloween night , having taken on the personality of a much better monster from a much better monster movie , and sets about killing people . ( There 's a weak storyline given as to why he does so , but it is entirely inconsistent with his actions . ) Yeah , that 's basically it.Let 's face it , if you 're watching Jack-O , you 're watching it because you 've heard that both Brinke Stevens and Linnea Quigley are in it . This is true . There are also some other hot horror babes involved ( Helen Keeling [ who has never been seen on screen again , for reasons that will become obvious when you watch the movie ] , Maddisen Krown , Rachel Carter , and a couple of others with bit parts ) .

She goes WAY too fast for a beginner and keeps saying `` exhale , exhale , exhale '' but when are you supposed to inhale ? Because she is not actually instructing as she goes through the workout she does not give you enough time or instruction about what is coming up next . She will be explaining exactly what she is doing and just as you are figuring it out she switches again . Also , sometimes they zoom in on the face of the person who is doing a modified exercise .

       " \"Probably the two best films about that misunderstood painful part of America 's history is Apocalypse and Full Metal Jacket . And even they may spend too much time evaluating the ancient conflict between the Pharaoh and the Jews ( good and evil ) instead of pride and punishment.I admire even more the quote from Tennyson about his son 's death at the Somme , `` when they ask you why they died tell them because their fathers lied . '' Along with Macnamara and Nixon and Kissenger and the Generals and Johnson and Kennedy.The simplicity of that observation is , I feel , the more interesting quest but also may be the least lucrative . I wonder sometimes when we made the movies about Vietnam and saw them and talked about them and saw them again , were we in search of a true vision of the conflict or were we in search of what might be a better product to market , the war having been over and done with and now only a sad memory in the minds of those who lost sons and daughters , and a still fertile battleground to contemplate the 'whys ' in the heads of its survivors.Because with a sports mentality for keeping statistics about Vietnam , the one that sticks in my mind forever is that 'never in the history of war have more survivors committed suicide than those that were killed in the war . ' Kind of catches in your throat , does n't it ? The great thing about Captain Willard 's ( Martin Sheen , maybe at his best ) mission ( the ceiling fan still geeks me ) is that it does encourage the journey into duplicity . Good wars ; Bad wars ; good drugs ; bad drugs ; remorseful convicted defendants ; unremorseful convicted defendants , who decides ? Ditto Brando and Duvall and the excellent cast in their supporting roles . This is an extraordinary movie and somewhere , it should be required reading ( observing ) for classes in high school . It probably is less of a movie about war than truly a visit to the Heart of Darkness.The best thing about Apocalypse that jumps right there in your face , is that it is so disturbing . That 's how I think we should feel .

Wells ' mistress , Rebecca ( Alexandra Paul ) , weary of his harsh treatment of her , steals a CD-ROM which contains encrypted data requisite for the weapon 's implementation , with the hope of capitalizing her escape and freedom but understands she will not be able to achieve her objective alone , thereby luring naive Jack Morris ( Martin Kemp ) , navigator aboard the tycoon 's yacht , to aid her in her flight . Jack and his Cockney shipmate Manny ( Adam Ant ) have their shore leave interrupted by Rebecca 's plans , particularly so since Morris permits feelings of compassion to bring him into a romantic involvement with the waifish temptress , who induces him into having the stolen data tattooed upon his back within a dragon-like design , and soon Wells and an opposition troupe are literally after Jack 's hide ( the original title was Sailor 's Tattoo ) . The comic book background of scriptor James Robinson is easily visible throughout this low budget film as there is but meagre development of his characters , and neophtye director Erik Fleming is not yet adept in the craft of pacing , but there are scintillas of wit , and savoury acting turns from James Hong and from Hays as a wryly devilish Wells .\",\n",
       " \"We 've all heard the tired-expression that all good things must come to an end . In the case of Claymore , the sixth chapter ( titled `` The Awakening '' ) is charged with the task of closing up the epic goth shonen series.Coming in at a runtime of 95 minutes , the Chapter 6 Funimation release contains 4 episodes ( # 23 through 26 ) on a single disc housed in a standard DVD case . The show wears a very appropriate TV MA ( 17+ ) rating due to some rough language , topless female nudity ( or maybe topless monster nudity is more appropriate ) , and a near-endless succession of violent/gory sequences.Extras are surprisingly robust and include a nice 24 page full color book highlighting key characters from the series , a commentary track from some of the English voice actresses over Episode 26 , original TV commercials , textless songs , and a crop of Funimation trailers.Language options are standard fair sub and dub , which of course means dialog presented in either original Japanese ( Stereo ) or an English dub in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround . And , like always , the choice to run English subtitles exists for either spoken language option.The show , for those who are unaware , concludes the tense setup Chapter 5 went out of its way to establish . In fact the first episode of this set ( # 23 ) literally opens in the middle of a heated battle between the half-Awakened Claire and Rigaldo , the Silver-Eyed Lion King in the snowy , lifeless town of Pieta . There is no recapping , no flashbacking , and no reestablishing of any kind so latecomers to the series would be wise not to pick this set as a starting point.Once the bloody confrontation between the Claymores and Rigaldo comes to its bloody conclusion , the show wastes very little time setting up the next ( and final ) battle with the Awakened creature Pricilla . At the risk of sparing you spoilers , let 's just say that the pacing is mind-numbingly swift in this pair of two-parters and the inevitable grand conclusion comes pretty quickly.The artistry and ambiance established within the show have always been particularly noteworthy and this volume is no exception . The first two episodes maintain the dark , cloudy skies and gentle snowfall that was established in Chapter 5 while the remaining two episodes introduce bursts of background color in the form of flowing lava and showering sparks ( ala Star Wars Episode III 's final battle on Mustafar ) .Like before many of the subtle effects ( falling snowflakes , creeping shadows , tongues of flame from campfires and so on ) are computer generated while the character models are internationally drab and bleak . This all adds up to spectacular attention to detail through minor contrasts.Fancy combat moves and lightening-quick sword slashing still dazzle in the heat of battle but ( thankfully ) the show 's creative teams made certain to display the results from several perspectives so as not to bore the viewer with mere blurry character models.The soundtrack , which has always been solid and eerily appropriate , continues to work its near subliminal magic here . Of course the battles introduce a sharp spike in tempo and guitar wailing but it works nearly as effectively as the hauntingly quiet melodies that lace the more tension-filled segments.The English dub has received mixed reviews in the past but seems to have come together quite well for the final quartet of episodes . Chalk it up either to the fact that the actors must really have known the character personalities by this stage in the game or simply the emotionally driven script that fuels the grand finale . Either way the dub works as well as the original Japanese dialog work , which seemed to have picked up on the grand scheme of things much earlier on.In all , purists and fans of the show are likely waiting impatiently for this July 14th release and neophytes may want to use this opportunity to begin the entire saga from the first chapter onward . Hopefully now that this , the final chapter has been completed and released ; Funimation will consider packaging up the entire saga into a single collection . This is definitely a title that deserves such treatment .\",\n",
       " \"On first glance , this 4 1/2 hour series is about Civil War battlefields . When you watch it though , you discover that the company recycles the same blurred out & quot ; artsy & quot ; video clips in every single video and throws in choppy simulations of silent films that , upon first glance , appear to be scenes from & quot ; Birth of a Nation. & quot ; They are n't . It is just as well that it 's blurred because it covers up some of the defects of this low scale fiasco . The company is based in Eugene , Oregon , and it seems doubtful that they ever left that state even to take reenactment footage . A blurred out clip of Burnsides Bridge was used for both Manassas , Sharpsburg and Fredericksburg . I was expecting an in depth discussion of each battlefield with full colored realistic reenactment footage . If you are looking for quality and scholarship , you wo n't find it in this one .\",\n",

Read them to get a more in-depth summary of this filmI have mostly watched the American classics ( silents through the 50 's ) and have recently expanded my movie universe to French/Japanese classics . What an eye opening experience so far.This movie is long but it did n't seem long at all . Great character development ... incredible scenes . The story was awesome and so moving . I was literally stunned at the ending . Such a non-Hollywood way of doing it . This movie was so enchanting that I was so sad that the movie had to end . THAT is a sign of a great movie or book . Another trait is when you know you ca n't live without seeing/reading this movie/book again in your life.This movie is best when it is in French with legible subtitles . Criterion did a fine job and the commentary seemed really good from what little snatches I heard . I really think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen ... and I 've seen a lot.It might take a little while to warm up to this movie . Have an open mind and you will be in for a treat as you approach the half hour mark ! Take a risk ... buy it . I really think you will love it !\",\n",
       " \"As others have said here ( except for one dissenter ) this is a marvelous series . Those who were too young to see it when it appeared on PBS 40 years ago ( was it really that long ago ? ) , have the opportunity to see a truly educational program , unlike much of what is advertised as such these days ( NOVA excluded ! ) .Other reviewers have covered well the content of this series , so I will add only a few comments : - The title Civilization is unfortunate , especially with the passage of time . Better by far to have been called Western Civilization ; or European Civilization , as the Series is very limited in covering a ) the early part of Western Civilization , namely Greece and Rome , and b ) covering the latter part of Western thought with the contributions from Europeanized `` colonies '' in North America and elsewhere . It no doubt prompted our lone dissenting reviewer to call it a `` glorification of White Christianity '' .- The quality of the video is pretty bad , for what is advertised as a 2010 release that has been `` digitally restored and remastered '' according to the packaging . This is a shame as it is the artwork that is the main star of this piece , not Lord Clark . It is said elsewhere that the BBC shot this in 35mm , and has recently released a Blu-ray version using this source . So the source media does exist to produce a high quality standard DVD release . But what they released in 2010 does not in any way come up to that standard - it would not be an exaggeration to say that it not much better than VHS in quality.- To expand on this point , I have a high quality DVD player ( standard DVD , not Blu-ray ) and routinely play commercial movies that show very high quality and crisp resolution , MUCH higher in quality than this DVD does . So it 's not the player that is at fault here.I considered returning this DVD to Amazon due to its poor quality , but because the content is so good I will probably keep it anyway . I will deduct one star though.In the meantime , if the BBC gets to read this PLEASE make a second re-release of this DVD ( non-Blu-ray ) based on the 35mm original print . Amazon , can you also convey this to the BBC ? Thanks !\",\n",
       " 'Ike : Countdown to D-Day is a well-acted , well-written WWII film , that chronicles the 90 days prior to the D-Day invasion . Absent are the bloody battle scenes from Saving Private Ryan and Flags of Our Fathers , replaced by a blow-by-blow account of the planning and organizing that went into Operation Overlord . Tom Selleck delivers a masterful performance as Eisenhower , clearly showing the stress and strain that came with such a huge undertaking . The responsibility of Supreme Commander seems to come easy to Ike on the surface , but under that calm visage Eisenhower wrestles with the issues facing the Allies from both Nazi Germany , and his own command structure . Juggling huge egos and heavy decisions takes its toll on the general , but his leadership is eventually vindicated by the success of the D-Day invasion.Any fan of World War II films should see this movie . It is an excellent addition to the WWII/war film genre .',\n",

       " \"I 've been an admirer of Liam Neeson for several years . I respect how he dares to bring complexity and humanity to nearly every part he does . In this film , these qualities shine brilliantly . Very rarely -- especially in modern films does a writer dare to admit or even suggest that the antagonist or 'baddie ' is still Human . This film 's writer not only suggests it but proves it powerfully via Neeson 's superb performance.Both James and Liam give gripping performances as Little and Griffen . The characters are very credibly done , having emotional and mental wounds . This is not an action piece . For which , I 'm very grateful . Instead , it 's a drama that 's intelligent and challenges the viewer 's perceptions . A 'thinking person 's ' film , if you will . This type of film seems a dying breed so I 'm grateful to have found it . Unlike in Taken , Liam 's char is n't thirsting for revenge ... he is in fact , a traumatized man searching diligently for healing and peace.Whereas Griffen is consumed by hate and pain and believes revenge will give him the satisfaction and solace he longs for . Very human but also very misguided . I do n't think reconciliation actually occurred between Griffen and Little . Instead , I feel an understanding was finally truly achieved which demonstrated one man 's change of heart and caused the other 's . This film is about hope , healing , forgiveness , and redemption . Well executed and I 'll happily own my copy within a few days ! For the reviewer that was so impressed with Liam in Taken , may I suggest Michael Collins ? It 's an action-drama and both Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman are very good in it . Though it 's very gritty and full of language . Yet , if one looks beyond these details to the heart beneath the story is a powerful one .\",\n",
       " \"How can I possibly express my disappointment at this unwarranted mangling of a perfectly charming little movie ? A big fan of the original cut of _Erik the Viking_ , and having nearly worn out my old VHS copy , I was eagerly anticipating the DVD release . I was a little surprised when the negative reviews here indicated that the movie had been severely edited ( - 25 minutes ! ) for the DVD release , and decided to rent it before buying . This was fortunate , because I not only saved myself a few dollars , but the disappointment of having rewarded those responsible for this inexplicable re-cut.I could have , perhaps , coped with the fact that some of my favorite little moments have been edited out ( e.g . `` Slow down , you fool , no one can row that fast ! `` ) , but the edits are executed so abruptly , so haphazardly , that I have to wonder if the director 's son either suffers from ADHD or was paid for every second he could excise from the movie . Take , for instance , the scene in which Erik and his followers are walking through the outer hall of Valhalla in search of the gods , the heroic music is swelling in the background , and WHAM ! we get an immediate cut to the next shot . `` Jarring '' would be an understatement.Directors ( and presumably sons ) certainly reserve the right to go back and finesse their own works , however the director 's son has committed the same error in judgement as George Lucas did in finessing the hell out of a charming , if imperfect , film that the fans nevertheless adore . Due to the enormous outcry from Lucas ' legions of fans , he finally conceded to releasing the unedited original theatrical cuts of the _Star Wars_ movies on DVD . However , I fear that , since _Erik the Viking_ does not enjoy the phenomenal level of support of the Star Wars franchise , we will never see an original DVD release of our beloved little movie . What a shame .\",\n",
       " \"I think that the other reviewer below , Patrick B. Dandenault , was completely right in his guess of the story . The later part of the movie is imagination of Fred while he sits in his cell waiting for his execution . The screaming and smoke in the car at the very end of the movie when Fred is escaping police chase actually represent the execution at the electricity chair.This is a true masterpiece . Just do n't try to understand everything and let it go . Lynch 's movies are conceived and interpreted at a subconcious level.The closest masterpieces are `` Mulholland Drive '' , `` Twin Peaks : Fire Walk with Me '' ( however makes sense only if you watched Twin Peaks ) and `` Fight Club '' ( by David Fincher ) .

I am hopeful the DVD version will finally become available soon.As with all good movies , the promotion and casting are never the real reason fo success as much as whether the story and direction can create a psycological tie to the viewer . This one excelled for me in many ways.The exquisite soundtrack had it all . One of the first to use popular songs from a by-gone era to create a nostalgia , and the haunting `` Elmo 's '' theme that Timothy Hutton develeoped throughout the re-incarnation portion was brought to a head beautifully in the closing scene . I was brought to tears in the reunion ending . It still gives me the chills each time I see it . This Neal Young tune `` We Never Danced '' was treated wonderfully.Another fine aspect of this film that is a mystery is the casting of the character `` Emmett '' .

       " \"Boy , this is a tough one . The original & quot ; Night of the Living Dead & quot ; is a landmark genre milestone , deserving buckets of praise . Despite pitiful actors , crude make-up effects and a budget from hell , George A. Romero really struck a nerve in 1968 . He created a classic that still to this day stands out as one of the best . A classic in no need of any additional scenes ... Therefore , I can not for the life of me explain how much I HATE this new version of the film . The 15 minutes of new footage brings absolutely nothing to the story . Only confusion and irritation . There is a new religious angle ( given to us by the most hysterical and hideously overacted priest in cinematic history ) , that completely ruins the quiet mood of the original . Some extra gore-scenes and shots of more modern looking ghouls have been added , replacing several well known zombie shots from the 60 's version . The soundtrack has been completely replaced by modern synthesized music , a move that finally puts the lid on the original movie , turning it into a modern day techno extravaganza with the 60 's atmosphere of a Marilyn Manson concert . The most tremendously clumsy and idiotic fault is that the sound is out of sync with the action in many scenes , which really makes you wonder who in God 's name approved the final print . The only good thing I can say about this new edition is that the picture quality has never been better . Super sharp and crystal clear , the best transfer ever . I really suffer with Mr. Romero ... His first masterpiece has been bashed by critics , truncated by censors and marketed by greedy people who ripped him off financially . It has been remade and restored with terrible results and he will forever be associated with every worthless new experiment , churned out by dollar hungry amateurs determined to bank in on his name.I sincerely hope he had nothing to do with this release . Romero is a quality-buff , adamant about the perfection of his work . He is hardly mentioned in the narration , and I 'm pretty sure he 's happy about it . Because no matter what happens , George A. Romero will always be the one and only inimitable master of the living dead . No one can ever take that away from him ...\",\n",

       " \"` Matchstick Men ' is one of those movies that makes you realize why some actors have support . Up until watching this film I had been a ` Cage-Hater ' , a guy who just could n't wrap his head around all the critical support ( granted , I saw this movie before watching ` Adaptation ' and since watching that film I 've realized this man ` can ' act , he just chooses not to half the time ) . Here though Nicolas Cage gave me a brief glimpse of the man that everyone else sees . As con-artist Roy Waller , Cage gives us a brilliant performance.My main problem with Cage has been his stiff natured acting , the fact that every time he speaks it feels as if he 's reading a prompter card , and so I think that the fact that his character here suffers from a severe case of OCD ( obsessive compulsive disorder ) helps a lot in that regard since he 's supposed to sound stiff and unnatural.Roy works with fellow con Frank ( Sam Rockwell ) , the young hotshot prot & eacute ; g & eacute ; who has higher ambitions than Roy himself , and this is causing them to butt-heads a bit . The real drama though comes in the form of Angela ( Alison Lohman ) , a young 14-year old who claims to be his daughter . At first Roy 's put off and distant , but after Angela shows major interest in her fathers line of ` work ' they begin to bond by pulling small con-jobs together . Meanwhile Frank is getting more and more agitated with the new bond between father and daughter because it 's causing a strain on a big job they have coming up.Filled with twists and turns and an ending I never saw coming , ` Matchstick Men ' is the perfect kind of caper . It 's got great acting from a cast I never knew had it in them and a great moral message that manifests itself as the film unravels . Alison Lohman is charming and natural and Sam Rockwell is the perfect side-kick , but the real shocker ( at least to me ) was the mere fact that Nicolas Cage steals the show from everyone !\",\n",
       " \"If you have read my other reviews , you know I like complex , layered topics . Ida Lupino is now my role model as a filmaker actress . If this film were made today it would be called and `` indie '' . Back then it was called `` low budget '' . Clearly , though , this type of thoughtful , well acted , sensitive , insightful look at a difficult subject is where the indie movement has come from . This film handles the subject of Bigamy from the standpoint of the story of this `` regular guy '' who ends up in a situation we come to understand from all its angles , who allows himself to be undone by applying to adopt a child and submitting to the background check . I can not begin to describe how well this is handled . For a subject that reeks with potential melodrama , every single element is drawn from the characters , and the choices they are making . Joan Fontaine clearly had courage and an eye for thoughtful and controversial subjects ( remember , Hitchcock 's suspicion was supposed to - from the book story - end in her complicity in her own murder at the hands of her husband ) . She handles her role here so deftly ... the character that we assume to be the `` perfect wife '' is unveiled as being very myopic and disregarding her marriage . Ida Lupino gives herself the role of the working girl who asks no questions , so that she does n't have to hear any lies . Edmund O'Brien , usually cast as the hulking tough , must have been delighted to have this morally complex , but remarkably unconflicted role . This film is simply a revelation . What is lovely is that the film recognizes all the typical things society would say about this situation , but we see the individuals , and they see each other , with human foibles and compassion . Clearly , too this is one of the precursors to films like `` Days of Wine and Roses '' and `` A Patch of Blue '' in the next decade ... films that took basically ordinary characters and put them in situations that were frowned on by society . The material is `` of it 's time , '' the elements and attitudes toward it would be very different today . But this is simply a masterful moment of film history that stands up to time .\",\n",
       " \"Let me just start by saying that I am very open to different styles of films and different approaches . I am also a very big fan of the genres of horror or suspence . Having said that , this film basically took the approach of shooting several incoherent scenes ( since when is it terrifying to just shake the camera around and use lame camecorder type effects to create terror ) of it 's protagonist walking around or laying in bed . Trust me when I say that those who liked this film must have been drunk , and basically chalked up the shotty story to their inebriation ( sorry folks no one understands this film , even sober ) or simply trying to rectify to themselves their having wasted money and time on this movie.I wo n't go into what it 's about too much as you can read the other reviews on that . Let me say that this film fails in all of the following areas.Suspense-there is n't much suspense over the initial 45 minutes of the protagonist simply acting weird , thinking weird things , or dreaming of weird things . So what ? Story-Did these guys write this story in seperate parts , throw them together and kill their editor ? This had to be the most inchorent pile of garbage every considered a story to be on a movie screen , or tv screen for that matter . I actually looked at my watch several times and thought , `` they do n't have much time left to get to some point or go somewhere with this film . `` Acting-it was overdone and humurous ( when it was n't supposed to be ) .Direction-convinced there was no director.basically over and over during the film , my wife and I kept saying , `` this is really stupid . '' I think we finished the film as a badge of honor of sorts . We made it into a funny psuedo myster science theater-look at this pile of garbage type event.I 've only seen maybe one or two other films in MY LIFE that were this bad.I plead with the director , just because you got a camcorder for christmas does n't make you a movie maker . Not a legit one.To wrap this up , the ending of the film was such a freaking predictable letdown , that I laughed out loud , then thought back to all of the ridiculous scenes that had nothing to do with it.Actually this film did make me laugh . So it got a star for that.Should 've known better though . Any film which has it 's packaging try to explain itself so much on the back of the box probably has it 's reasons for doing so ...

Anyway I really did n't see much values in this family film , apart from good ol ' Glenn Close and the dogs . Yes , the dogs are still very cute and make the movie bearable enough . However , the story is absurd , the typical predictability deal is here in this movie and I did n't laugh very much . Apart from the ending where Cruella literally gets baked , this film is pretty much comedy-free . Kids will find it hard to laugh at this flick and to generally enjoy this film too . Even they 're little minds will not be tricked by the movies dotty silliness . Adults will be dragged along by kids to see this sequel , but I 'm sure none of them will think too much of it . Sure , 102 Dalmatians has some good points - the groovy opening song , Glenn Close 's excellent performance , the funny ending and the cuteness of the dogs - but ultimately it does n't succeed . This is a sequel that you will only be bothered watching while you 're one a plane or a boat or something just to pass the time . I 'll ask again , someone please tell me the point of this movie ?

Many of the title cards are so dark as to be unreadable ; surely it would have been a simple matter to create new title cards for this release -- unless the Grapevine people could n't read them either .

       " \"I was n't sure what to expect when I saw `` The Bourne Identity . '' Having never read the book or seen the TV miniseries , I knew little about the premise . In addition , I was n't sure how well Matt Damon would do playing an action hero.What I saw was an excellent movie with a great cast and terrific acting.Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne , an amnesiac who knows his name only because it was on a passport he found with his picture on it . He does n't know where he has been , where he lives , or what he does for a living . The only thing he knows is that he found a safety deposit box that belongs to him with tens of thousands of dollars of money , several more passports , and a gun . Oh yeah ... . and people keep trying to kill him.Although the movie starts a little on the slow side ( which was necessary to set up the premise ) , once it gets started it keeps going with barely a chance to catch your breath.Another reason to like this movie : the director did not mess it up by inserting a pointless and unneeded love sequence . Yes , you know the two main characters will get together at some point . However , once we see that they are going to get together , we do n't see them going at it . No scenes of them falling into bed together , and no scenes of them waking up together the next morning . More movies need to comprehend the idea of less is more.This DVD Collector 's Edition also contains several great extras . One of my favorites is the alternate ending which was apparently filmed and then , wisely , scrapped . In addition , you can view four deleted scenes which had been , also wisely , scrapped , and an extended farmhouse scene . There is also a `` Making Of '' commentary in this section.If you are a Matt Damon or an action fan , this is one movie that you are going to want to see .\",\n",

It has an air of mystery about it from start to finish , it 's well-acted ( even David Caruso manages not to overact ) , and the ending leaves you satisfied but still pondering `` what just happened there ?

Good call , except the old lady dies the first night . The story stays good , and the acting is decent for the kid and adult actors . Give it a try !\",\n",
       " \"Boy Wonder is not a superhero movie . Although it shares a similar origin story to many of our favorite superheroes , Boy Wonder is about a kid , Sean , that witnesses his mother get murdered . He is haunted by this memory and decides to hunt down the man that killed his mom . Throughout the story , he 'll seek justice for others usually in a violent way ( often fist-fighting or shooting ) . There are other psychological aspects that you begin to notice during the second half of the film when you realize Sean may actually be mentally ill . The ending has some decent twists . The emotional story , the thrilling action , and even the comedy between the cops make this film a great one . The acting was great , and the music really stood out to me . Definitely one of the better films released recently . Is it a pure superhero film ? No . Do n't expect a huge budget with amazing special effects and mutated villains . This is a realistic film of a young man seeking justice.There is some violence and blood throughout the film , there is no sex or nudity so it 's pretty safe . If you 're even slightly interested , Boy Wonder is available on Netflix streaming as of 6/24/12 . I highly recommend you check it out .\",\n",

Par for our modern PC culture which fortunately R. L. Stevenson knew nothing about ( and yes , I have read the original story ) . SPOILER : the story ends by the `` hero '' Long John Silver sailing to Jamaica with Jim Hawkins and Ben Gunn ( the `` good guys '' of the show were killed during a fight at the treasure -- but the story was so twisted that you were actually glad they received their `` just reward '' in death ! ) .

       " \"Lush production value encompasses this flawless film based on the classic Jane Austen novel . Emma Thompson is triumphant both as the title character and as a screenwriter . Her adaptation is beautifully written and loaded with emotional subtleties , as is her performance . Kate Winslet plays her sister in the film , a perfect foil of unrepressed passion to her sister 's reserved depth of character . The entire cast is magnificent , for that matter . There are so many different characters entering and exiting the story that there is never any threat of boredom for lack of interesting people . The story itself is actually fairly simple , but it is the people who inhabit this fascinating time and place who both complicate and enhance everything around them . The cinematography is sumptuous , with deep greens and glowing sunshine , misty grays and extravagantly colorful indoor settings . The costumes are gloriously adorned and appropriately designed for the era . The look of this film is fantastic ! Then there is director Ang Lee , better known today for his stellar work on `` Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon . '' His previous film , `` Eat Drink Man Woman , '' more than hinted at his prowess as a possible international success with `` Sense and Sensibility . '' His work here is outstanding . This film was nominated for 7 Oscars , winning only for Best Adapted Screenplay going to Emma Thompson . Another movie entitled `` Braveheart '' won Best Picture that year . Other films along similar lines as `` Sense and Sensibility '' that I recommend highly are `` Howard 's End , '' in which Emma Thompson won the Best Actress Oscar but which is inexplicably not available on DVD , and an eccentric gem called `` Impromptu , '' in which she has a smaller role within yet another exceptional cast of actors . Both films are very European , in the best sense of the word . Highly recommended .\",\n",

IF THERE WAS A NEGATIVE SCALE FOR THE RATINGS , I 'D HAVE GIVEN THIS JUNK A -100 ! ! ! This movie has awful acting ! [ ... ] The characters all act the same , and they state the obvious a little too much ... so much so that I think they 're all afflicted with mental problems .

Tara Reid ( crappy actor # 1 ) walks in and lies down next to Christian Slater ( crappy actor # 2 ) and suddenly , they 're having sex ! ! Sheesh ! Where did that come from ? ! Anyways ... this movie has a stupid plot , and is very confusing . It makes NO sense whatsoever . By the end of the movie , the normal people are done trying to make sense of it and just laughing their butts off . The rest walk out and give it five star ratings like the idiots they are . Not even Tara Reid 's hotness could save this one . Do n't even consider seeing it , you 're running the risk of wasting five bucks .

       " \"I have never read any of Tom Clancy 's works , but I have seen all the movies made from them . Patriot Games is one of them.The storyline is quite simple : Jack Ryan ( Harrison Ford ) , former CIA analyst , is on vacation/lecture tour in England with his family . While on the way to meet them near Buckingham Palace , he & his family are caught in a cross-fire during an assassination attempt on a member of the Royal Family , Lord Holmes ( Edward Fox ) , by a rogue faction of the IRA led by Sean Miller ( Sean Bean ) . In the ensuing shoot-out , Jack killed one the terrorists , who happens to be Sean 's younger brother . Jack gets drawn back into the CIA after the terrorists set out a vengeful attack against his family back in USA.In my view , the action sequences in this movie are not very exciting , when compared with any of the recent Bond & /or Bourne movies , although the entire movie is quite entertaining . I particularly enjoyed the sequence showing a real-time satellite-tracking session at CIA HQ , during which Jack & his counter-terrorism team are watching a crack SAS team conducting a black ops raid at the terrorists ' hideout somewhere in Libya . The accompanying music score is realistically haunting ! What excites me most about this movie is watching Jack exercising his astute power of observation & his uncanny ability to juxtapose images in a relentless attempt to track down the whereabout of the rogue faction of the IRA , ... with the high-tech resources of CIA 's counter-terrorism group , of course.Using vital information secured from Paddy O'Neil ( Richard Harris ) , an IRA supporter in the USA , Jack narrows down the search through his observation/juxtaposition of CIA 's satellite images ( which includes an overhead snapshot of an apparently capped woman with a pony tail ) with his own recalled images : - a back-view glimpse of the pony-tailed driver in the terrorists ' getaway vehicle during the foiled assassination attempt in England ; - a side-view glance of the pony-tailed driver in the terrorists ' getaway vehicle during an unsuccessful assassination attempt on his life outside the US Naval Academy ; All these associations have been triggered while taking a break & walking pass a pony-tailed woman employee on the way to answer the call of nature at CIA Headquarters.What a brilliant piece of detective work - observation plus juxtaposition - on the part of Jack ! The Power of Observation & Juxtaposition are obviously requisite character traits of a CIA analyst.In summing up this review , I have enjoyed very much watching Patriot Games , experientially as well as educationally . This is another wonderful addition to my resource repertoire .\",\n",
       " \"If you can look beyond the usual staccato Mametian dialogue and the uneveness always caused by casting Mamet 's wife Rebecca Pidgeon in the leading female role , then you 've got yourself a very fine movie - probably David Mamet 's best as writer/director in my opinion . I know many people will choose 'House of Games , ' but I thought the 'Prisoner ' storyline was better , and I really like the work turned in by Mamet novices Campbell Scott ( whose combination of brains and naivete drives the film ) , Ben Gazzara and especially Steve Martin , who plays totally against type here.In the Mamet-penned 'Wag the Dog ' we hear over and over again & quot ; It 's a pageant. & quot ; Replace that here with & quot ; It 's a process. & quot ; We hear over and over again about The Process . We never find out what exactly the Process is ( that 's not the point ) , but all actions and reactions in 'Prisoner ' involve securing , stealing and resecuring The Process . It 's a classic Mametian plot device and it works great here . For Mamet fans , there 's a subset of regulars , most notably Mamet house players Ricky Jay and Jerry Graff . [ 'Glengarry Glen Ross ' fans ought to recognize that name . ] Also - be on the lookout for Ed O'Neill for a brief - but memorable - turn as an FBI Team Leader.And keep your eyes on that suitcase .\",\n",

However , it 's really just a lot of walking in place , on your tiptoes and stepping side-to-side . I think it was made REALLY tedious by the fact that you repeated these moves as if they were really complicated . I guess they wanted to make the routines accessible to the masses , but it does not provide enough challenge for an adequate workout . My heartrate barely elevated , if at all . This routine would get boring very quickly , as there is no room to grow . Even the most rhythm challenged individual would be able to pick up the steps the first time they tried the DVD.One of the few positives is that the dancers leading the workout have vibrant personalities , but it is not enough to sell me on this workout.The DVD is 36 minutes long , and the dance routine is divided into 4-5 min sections led by the different cheerleaders . The music in the routine is a very nondescript , and the moves do n't coincide with the beat at all . If they decide to make another dance workout DVD , I would recommend that they include more complicated dance moves and better music . I just can not recommend this very boring DVD . If you are looking a fabulous dance workout DVD , try Dance off the Inches : Hip Hop Party or Lindsay Brin 's Dance Jam ( which is also by NFL cheerleaders , but includes much better dance moves ) .\",\n",

       " \"`` Mostly Martha '' is well-done comedy/drama in which star Martina Gedeck does an outstanding job of portraying her complex character , Martha . Many reviewers have commented on the food metaphor in the movie , and there is no doubt that the sensual pleasure of food is highlighted here . The romantic-comedy elements are also present in the initial conflicts , growing respect , and eventual relationship between Martha and Mario . However , this movie is far more interesting and complex than the usual romantic comedy.Gedeck does an outstanding job of portraying all of Martha 's vulnerabilities , which is what makes both main storylines - her relationship with Mario and her relationship with her niece , Lina - so affecting . Martha is an insecure woman who excels at cooking , and she will not take any risks in life unless she can put her cooking talents to use in the process . We see this in her interactions with her therapist and her new next-door neighbor ( who initially seems as though he may become her romantic interest ) . When Martha 's sister is killed in a car accident and Martha takes in her niece , Lina , her only initial attempts at consoling the girl involve trying to get her to eat . Indeed , Martha is what can best be described as an obsessive control freak when it comes to cooking and eating.Having said that , I must emphasize again that Gedeck does such an outstanding acting job that the viewer remains sympathetic to Martha ( with perhaps the exception of one scene that involves Lina and school ) throughout the film , which is rarely the case between such obsessive characters and viewers . We understand that she fears openness , closeness , and - above all - rejection.The dramatic and comedic elements are nicely interwoven so that the viewer is never overwhelmed by some of sadder aspects of the story but also does n't forget that the story involves a young girl who has lost her mother . The comedic elements are present throughout the movie , though they are rarely of the laugh-out-loud style ( except the scene in which Martha hyperventilates when she sees what a mess Mario is making of her kitchen - it is Martha 's neuroses that provide much of the comedy , as well as some of the drama , in the film ) . The writer ( s ) and director , Sandra Nettelbeck , provide a model example of how comedy is effectively used to relieve the tension created by dramatic incidents . I highly recommend this film for viewers who enjoy movies that are character-driven rather than action-driven . I also commend the filmmakers for showing restraint and not including the ( usually inevitable ) sex scene that most such relationship movies have . My personal beliefs still do n't agree with the implied sex , but thanks to the filmmakers ' better judgment the movie remains a true romantic comedy rather than becoming a sex comedy .\",\n",
       " \"VOYAGE TO A PREHISTORIC PLANET was made in 1965 , stars Basil Rathbone , and the cover depicts one snarling and one glaring dinosaur towering over three space-suited astronauts . Does anything more really need be said ? Plot - The year is 2020 and American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts are traveling to Venus . I 've read somewhere that this is a Russia film that had scenes inserted and some phony American credits plastered on it prior to release , but was n't interested enough to see if my favorite internet search engine could cough up the answers to that mystery . Rathbone plays a scientist on the satellite Lunar 7 and the other ` star ' in this one , Faith Domergue , is an astronautlette on the Venus-orbiting Vega . A handful of ` nauts and John the Robot are on the Venus surface , dodging the stray alamosaurus and/or 12-foot-tall man-eating venus flytrap while finding evidence of an ancient Venusian civilization . There probably was an okay Russian movie here before Roger Corman Productions got their hands on this one . John the Robot is cool and some of the special effects are a cut above the standard glop they were putting out then . The story drags terribly , though , and Rathbone is apparently included for name recognition rather than to serve the plot or to move things along . Thankfully , they do n't dress him up in a goofy costume or otherwise embarrass him . The pacing is terrible , the dubbing is atrocious and there 's no drama to speak of . The print , although the color is somewhat washed out and there are some scratches , is in okay condition . Not recommended .\",\n",
       " \"Altruism , benevolence , a mother 's love for her son and pure , unadulterated evil are the key elements in one of the most dynamic and emotionally charged ( as well as overlooked ) films of the year ( 2000 ) , `` Dancer In the Dark , '' directed by Lars von Trier . Icelandic singer Bjork stars as Selma Yeskova , a single mother living in a small town in Washington State , who works in a factory to support herself and her ten-year-old son , Gene ( Vladan Kostic ) . Selma works her fingers to the bone , taking double shifts and doing whatever she can to save enough money for an operation Gene will need when he turns thirteen to correct an inherited , genetic condition that will eventually rob him of his sight . And Selma knows only too well the effects of the disorder ; even as she works towards accruing the sum needed for the operation , she is coping with the onset of her own imminent blindness . Besides her son , her one passion in life is movie musicals , which she has loved since she was a little girl ; she grew up with them , and now it is to them that she turns in her mind when life closes in on her and threatens to become unbearable . When she is overwhelmed and overburdened , she hears music in the sounds of the factory and finds rhythm in the work . In the musicals she finds the respite from concern she needs to carry on , escaping to a place where `` nothing dreadful ever happens . '' Set in 1964 against a backdrop of the beautiful rural Pacific Northwest , the content of von Trier 's film is so real and it is so visually engrossing that at times it 's like watching a home video . And it makes you more than merely an observer of Selma 's life ; you become involved . You share the joy of a mother watching her son ride his first bicycle ; you sense the `` community '' of her friends and co-workers who help make her life bearable . Von Trier successfully manages to avoid any maudlin sentimentality , and instead tells the story in a voice that is straightforward and creates an intense , emotionally complex and memorable film that ultimately takes you to a place that , in the beginning , you would never have dreamed possible . In a way , it all sneaks up on you , until suddenly you find yourself caught up and swept away in an emotional torrent . Discovering a great film is always exciting ( and without question this is one ) , but when it includes an astounding new talent , as well , it is indeed a thrill . And such is the case here . For as Selma , Bjork quite simply gives one of the best performances of the year , and how she got passed over for an Oscar nomination is beyond me . A gifted individual , she brings subtle nuance to the character , and conveys a humanity of singular depth that makes Selma , and the fact that she is so adamant in her undertaking , more than real and believable . That the viewer is able to be drawn in and affected on such a personal level with this film is a direct result of Bjork 's natural ability as an actress . Granted , von Trier led the way , and her co-stars ( especially David Morse , in a terrific performance as her friend , Bill ) provided invaluable support , but the real connection this film makes with audience is through -- and because of -- Bjork . The supporting cast includes Catherine Deneuve ( Kathy ) , Peter Stormare ( Jeff ) , Udo Kier ( Dr. Porkorny ) , Joel Grey ( Oldrich Novy ) , Vincent Paterson ( Samuel ) , Cara Seymour ( Linda ) and Stellan Skarsgard ( Doctor ) . Much of the strength of von Trier 's film lies in the implied , as well as the overt aspects of it , and in the end , `` Dancer In the Dark '' will leave you with many things to ponder for some time to come , especially concerning those `` gray areas '' of the human condition . Rationale , motivation , the distorted priorities to which it seems so many people are prone , as well as proof of the existence of true goodness that many do , in fact , carry in their hearts . Emotionally devastating , this is a film that demands reflection . Unfortunately , it raises many questions to which -- just as in real life -- there are simply no real answers .\",\n",

If I was to be more specific and explain what the remedy is for I would ruin the plot , so , I wo n't do that ! I will tell you , since I take writing these capsule reviews very seriously that I do n't believe that this film is worthy of your time . Based on a novel by Luis Chu , EAT A BOWL OF TEA examines 1940s United States and the Chinese-American experience in this country . Due to a stringent immigration act , all Chinese men coming abroad the USA to seek work were forced to leave their wives behind . Chinese women were not allowed to accompany their husbands , when they came seeking jobs to support their families back home . Thus , the older Chinese men who had settled in this country twenty years before , were aging alone , without the possiblity of bringing first born sons into the world , to continue their familial lineage . In spite of miscygenation laws , Chinese and Chinese-American men would sometimes keep company with Caucasian women , as is depicted in the example of the young main character , Ben Loy ( Russell Wong ) . Ben is sent home to China , by his father , to meet and marry a nice Chinese girl . When he finds her ( Cora Miao ) and they get married , Loy becomes impotent ( one factor possibly being stress -- especially , the stress of producing an heir -- something that is mandatory in the eyes of Ben 's father , as well as their community ) . This leads to unfortunate circumstances and choices based on frustration and embarrassment.Why did n't this film work for me ? Well , for starters , themes of family obligation , extramarital affairs , and bicultural identity were handled in a very clumsy way and the poor acting certainly did n't help . Russell Wong 's delivery of the lines was wooden ( at best ) and the other characters seemed more like poorly-developed caricatures . What 's more , a seduction scene that should have been sexy was more creepy . In fact , more than one of us watching this scene thought that it almost came off more as a rape scene , which was incredibly disturbing . Skip this one .\",\n",

UGH ! This film is supposed to be in 2.35:1 but instead Artisan , for some reason , released it in a mutilated 1.33:1 . This is not right .

Well , I can say my son has seen it about 20 times by now and really likes it . He has the Cranky and Flynn TrackMaster set and re-enacts the fire sequence and makes up his own play , which tells me it captured his imagination.The movie is beautiful to look at . It starts with a fire , and Flynn ( fire engine that can go on tracks ) and Belle ( new engine who fights fires ) help put it out . Flynn is touted as a hero . Thomas is told by Sir Topham Hatt to take care of them , leaving Percy feeling abandoned . Diesel `` oils up '' to Percy and starts sowing the seeds of discord , and Diesel 10 is Percy 's new best friend who just wants something from him . In a brave move , Percy goes to the Diesel Works , and then when he finds out how run down it is and how the diesels lack even a crane , talks Kevin into going with him from the Steam Works.Diesel 10 schemes and manipulates and finally the time comes when everyone is away from the Steam Works . The diesels and Percy charge over to the Steam Works and take it over . I do n't think any parents will mind if I spoil the ending here , but Percy , Thomas , and Sir Topham Hatt end up confronting the diesels . Sir Topham Hatt is cross ( is n't he always ? = ) , but Thomas and Percy cut in to explain the poor conditions of the Diesel Works . A little later , everyone ( steamies and diesels ) work together to build a new Diesel Works.My son had big saucer eyes during the fire , and was a bit tense at times when Diesel 10 was being particularly devious . He was n't scared , but definitely anxious at certain points . The measure of the film , however , is that he has continued to ask for it again and again . I did n't like this one nearly as much as other Thomas movies , and less than the TV series . So 5 stars from my Thomas fanatic , 3 stars from me . Maybe it 's because Percy is so annoying !\",\n",

More than just a movie , Lonesome Dove presents insights into many aspects of life . It contains an underlying meaning going far beyond plot . It is one of the best examples of interpretive cinema to be found . Lonesome Dove presents to the viewer , moral lessons while it entertains . More than this though , Lonesome Dove just makes you feel good . It is an escape from everyday life through simple dialogue and lovable believable charachters that carry the reader away from his world and place him in Lonesome Dove , Texas , a place where life is slower and the hustle and bustle of modern life can not be found . It 's all-star cast led by Danny Glover , Tommy Lee Jones , and Robert Duvall present the charachters as Mcmurtry would have portrayed them . In my opinion , it is impossible to watch the entire six hour classic without tearing up or at least being thoroughly moved , not by its sadness but by its superb portrayal of the stirring emotion that brings with it a real , and lasting sense of joy and contentment . The best one word description of this classic of cinema is & quot ; beautiful & quot ; .Just thinking about this wonderful movie brings a sigh of joy and a lasting feeling of contentment .

Mitchell and her world-class backup band create one of the best concert albums ever.The video on the other hand features poor production values . The camera work is amateurish and the editing is awful . Why did Mitchell consent to releasing such sub-standard representation of an amazing concert ? I almost cried when it got to the jam during The Dry Cleaner from Des Moines and saw nothing but crappy shots of the Las Vegas strip.Now , both Jaco and Michael Brecker are gone . This video could have been a great video record of their talents , but no , it 's a cheesy music video that largely ignores the fact that some of the greatest musicians in the world were on stage .\",\n",

       " \"... that this is a `` Dawn of DVD '' product . That is , it was one of the first films ever released on DVD . I bought this product when it first came out , so I 've had it for over ten years . Back in 1999 we were just all awestruck by the fact that a movie would fit on something smaller than a brick ( VHS ) and might even have room for and contain a featurette . In this case your extra feature is the featurette `` Right Here in River City : The Making of Meredith Willson 's The Magic Man '' . There are also two trailers , and that is it.Looking at the film today , this disc is a dinosaur . The colors seem runny and the hue a bit off , and the sound is rather uneven . The disc can often be had for a greatly reduced price , and the quality is probably the reason why . This film is ripe for a redo and most probably a Blu-Ray release , so I would save my money until that time , if I was you.As far as the film itself as art , it is one of the great musical motion pictures . I ca n't imagine anyone but Robert Preston as fast-talking fast-thinking Professor Harold Hill , and then there 's my favorite line in the film as spoken by the mayor `` And now I 'd like to present a spectacle - my wife . '' The music is wonderful and memorable , and the whole thing just captures small-town life at the beginning of the twentieth century in such a charming way . I 've liked this film since I was in my 20 's , back when I thought that `` The Terminator '' was classic cinema.In summary , I could n't recommend the film more highly , but as for the DVD I 'd wait until Warner Home Video comes out with an upgraded product . One is long overdue .\",\n",
       " \"Brace yourself - intelligent sci-fi is n't dead , nor is it an oxymoron . You would n't have known that for several years , with dull releases such as Alien : Resurrection , Battlefield Earth , the new Star Wars travesties , Chronicles of Riddick , and Starship Troopers littering the sci-fi landscape with one dreadful bomb after another . Minority Report breaks that chain , and shows Steven Speilberg in top form once again.Of course it 's Spielberg - who else is out there to bring 5 start science-fiction to the screen ? This is the man that brought us E.T . over 20 years ago , also regarded as one of the greatest sci-fi movies in history . When he chooses to , Spielberg delivers movies with carefully crafted stories , fully developed characters that draw us in and that we care about , realistic scripts , and of course special-effects that support the film rather than stand center-stage as the main focus . This film is not only no exception , it raises Spielberg 's bar.Tom Cruise is well cast in his role as the cop at the center of the film , but the supporting cast is where the excellence truly lies . Max Von Sydow plays his role to perfection and never lets you really know , until the end , where his loyalties lie . Colin Farrell , playing Cruise 's foil , is more than just Hollywood 's new pretty boy here - this film gives him real meat to work with and act with . And he 's really good at it.This film exemplifies what science fiction film should be . Beyond eye-candy with too many special effect , sci-fi should be a reflection of our present condition and present day life , and should provoke us to think about ourselves , or our society , or our condition . This film does so and lends itself to multiple viewings , each time giving us something new to see or think about.I can not recommend this film too many times . Easily one of the ten best science fiction films in history .\",\n",

As for the Conspiracy itself , the movie contains a few elements that may have arguably been discredited but on the whole , it asks a lot of questions that have never been satisfactorily answered . After the shameful whitewash attempt by author Gerald Posner , 'Case Closed ' ( got ta love his arrogance ) JFK is like a breath of fresh air.Personally , I did n't like or trust Kennedy , so I do n't have a political axe to grind by aligning myself with the Pro-Conspiracy side . It 's just that there is enough questionable data to make any reasonable person doubt the official explanations . Gerald Posner 's utterly laughable 'explanation ' of the second shot as being a reflex action , in which JFK 's head suddenly jerked backwards , is all you need to hear to know that the level of intelligence of the anti-Conspiracy side is enough to give Homer Simpson a superiority complex . Olly Stone has got so much right here that the actual fine detail is almost irrelevant . He has gone a long way towards proving that a complex Conspiracy did in fact exist , and that 's without including some of the most extreme ( though not ridiculous ) theories.Just enjoy JFK as a piece of Art , because thanks to Stone , Costner and a stunning cast , that is what it is .\",\n",
       " '& quot ; Les Visiteurs & quot ; ( 1993 ) .I saw this film in letterbox format on Showtime Cable in June 1999 . ( The title sequences on the NTSC/VHS version are letterbox , but the bulk of the film is panned and scanned . ) I must have tuned in 10 or 15 minutes after the opening . It is the funniest film I have ever seen . I had to consider whether this could actually be true , because I laughed so hard that I could not always read the subtitles due to my tears ! What I like about this film is its playful absurdity . ( I never liked the & quot ; screwball comedy & quot ; genre until this film . ) The writers and actors seem to have an excellent sense of history , modern as well as medieval and of human nature . The premise is unbelievable , but is presented early in the film . The humanity , in particular the willingness of the characters to learn , to try new things and new language , is very naturally presented . This is what makes the film work . I am reminded of Peter Sellers in his 1979 film & quot ; Being There & quot ; . An unbelievable premise made believable and entertaining by the naturalness of the characters in an unnatural context.This film has profanity and violence which may be inappropriate for younger audiences . It contains medieval French which may produce interesting side effects for students of French who use this film as a motivational study aid ! I understand that a French language only version is available for U.S. ( NTSC ) players and that the 1996 sequel & quot ; Les Visiteurs 2 & quot ; is also available , without subtitles.I also understand that the original cast will remake the film in 2000 entirely in English . Somehow , despite my absent French , I can not imagine how this film could be improved upon . We will see .',\n",

       " \"`` Haunted Highway '' is a low-budget horror suspense directed by Japanese director . You may expect something scary and creepy like the original version of `` Ring , '' but `` Haunted Highway '' is actually more like a ride to boredom , where nothing but familiar tricks of horror genre happens.The film is about an American photographer Greg ( Rand Gamble ) who has an affair with a Japanese model Yumi ( Hinano Yoshikawa ) . Bitter accusation from his wife Amanda ( Laura Putney ) leads to one accident , which forces Greg to drive on the deserted midnight road to the lake . On the way Greg encounters several weird things that might drive his mind which is already confused to insanity.To create a gripping suspense or horror using a confined space like a car is a really challenging thing , but judging from the film the filmmaker is not up to the task . From the opening credit ( that looks like David Lynch 's `` Lost Highway '' ) to its ending , there is nothing that would interest us . The film uses up all the tricks in its first half , and the inserted flashback scenes ( of which content is already suggested in the pre-credit section ) are just unnecessary . The film 's passable acting and creaky dialogues ( especially in the first scene ) do not help . Hinano Yoshikawa is not known for her acting talent in Japan , but I never expected she could be that bad.But probably she should not be blamed because , according to the film 's official homepage , her English is dubbed by someone else . That fact makes me wonder why Japanese director Junichi Suzuki decided to make an English-speaking film entirely shot in America while the film 's locations and characters do not need to be American ( almost all the events on the `` highway '' scenes happen during one night ) . I know Mr. Suzuki has been living in USA since 2001 , but would n't it be a better choice for him to shoot a film in Japan where he had been working for a long time ? Anyway I agree with most of the previous reviewers who say `` Haunted Highway '' is a terrible film . It is , and I should have listened to .\",\n",

I really loved this movie and laughed the entire way through . I think that the biggest problem this movie has is the title . If it was called The Last Party , or Growing Up or even Friends Forever I think it would have done better because most people are either too offended or uptight to see a movie with this title . I will say there is quite a bit of nudity and sex in this , but nothing outrageous and a little more then `` Hall Pass '' or the `` Change-up '' ( which is the same type of comedy this is ) . Do n't be afraid of the title or embarrassed to watch it , this is a very very funny movie . Overall , a very surprisingly sweet and funny comedy that fans of `` Change-Up '' will love . I loved it .

Noonan and Cox bring the film to almost a 3 dimensional reality with performances that go far beyond what would be expected from a couple of ( at the time ) unknown actors.In my opinion , these guys really run the show . No disrespect to the outstanding work of William Petersen , who captures the role with a spooky resolve.He plays the role so well , That you realize as an actor , he 's really doing what he 's performing as an investagator.Getting in the heads of the people he 's pursuing/playing . The music is almost as much of a cast member as any of the actors.Music that is brilliant in its use and construction.If ever a soundtrack deserves a CD.Its this one ! Anyway , I have the basic `` Manhunter '' dvd , and the restored directors cut.I really enjoy the commentary's.The difference between the two , to me , is really a matter of the two different commentary's.The basic unit has the cast , Petersen , Noonan , Cox andAllen.The restored directors cut is Michael Mann going solo . Mann 's commentary is a collection of thoughts and techniques.Inspiration of character development and a lot of `` film school '' stuff that is of interest ... even to a layman ... The basic unit with the cast is a lot more interactive.No theydont exactly hoot it up , but it is slightly more entertainingas a behind the scenes deal goes . Mann 's comments are a plus in that he does enjoy the film andseems at times to be getting caught up in it.As a result , hehas moments where he doesnt speak , but instead watches the movie with the viewer.Kinda cool.You get to see the point hes making rather than having him talk over it as the moment goes by .

However , it must have been the Christmas spirit , I decided to give this one a try - and made a mistake.The saying `` less is sometimes more '' is definitely right when it comes to this tape . I 'm actually thinking of entirely giving up on the newer Firm tapes , since they seem to start using more and more fancy equipment making sure they include one of those `` special offer '' leaflets inside ; you should feel lucky you 've been given the chance at all . A true rip-off . They are using yet another type of a step-box kinda miracle here - no , it 's not even the Fanny Lifter anymore , it 's The Firm Box . Yay ! And even though it only says on the cover you 'll need a couple of dumbbells , they keep using some broomstick-like weight-thingy , too.Not only does the rip-off mentality make me sick , but so does the fact that while doing the exercises I was coming to realize that I did n't even need all that stuff after all.The instructor is terrible - the cueing is poor and I really thought the age of sickly skinny women looking like 12 year-old boys AND advertising fitness and a healthy way of life has long been over . This tape proves otherwise.The whole workout is about 30 minutes , including a warm-up and two streching sets - one after the lower body and another one after the abs workout . This latter one also goes to prove `` less is sometimes more '' - they seem to get so lost in different places to place different parts of that broomstick-like thing and including lower AND upper abs AND upper body exercises all in one breath that I found myself wondering what WAS going on after all.The reason I am still giving this tape two stars is that most of the lower body exercises are effective , even though I 'm sure that everyone that 's ever worked out has already been through all of them more than a few times . Most of them are those all-time favorites including mostly different types of leg-lifts.There are several great tapes out there - I 'd recommend trying those with Minna Lessing or `` Lift Weights To Lose Weight Part Two '' by Cathy Smith , but DEFINITELY not this one !\",\n",
       " \"Oh man , where do I start ? Most reviews of this movie seem to range from love to hate , with very few between . I think I fall in the 'between ' area . Moon 44 was directed by Roland Emmerich , who also directed Universal Soldier , Stargate , Independance day , The Patriot , and Godzilla . Oh yeah , he also produced and wrote Moon 44 . One of the stars in the movie , Dean Devlin , also produced Stargate , Independence Day , and Godzilla with Emmerich.The movie starts off by telling us it 's the future , and all Earth 's resources have been depleted , so companies have taken to space to exploit moons for their mineral resources . Competition for these moons is pretty fierce , as the material recovered from these moons is very valuable , and can make or break a company . One company has seen numerous moons hit , shuttles lost , and their profits gone , so when their last moon is threatened by what appears to a conspirator inside the company , the board of directors send an investigator to determine the truth , played by b-movie veteran Michael Pare ' . He goes undercover , as a one of a group of prisoners who have flight experience as pilots are hard to come by . Apparently it 's going to be these guys job to protect the moon and the robotic equipment from raiders by flying around in modified helicopters . Since the terrain they will be flying in is difficult , each pilot must work closely with a navigator , who is situated within the station , giving specific directions to the pilot . One wrong move could mean death . The navigators are the typical computer nerdy bunch , and do n't mix well with the harden prisoners when they show up . One prisoner decides to rape his navigator in the shower , and though we do n't get to see it , I thought it was a pretty bad idea of the prisoner to do such a thing since the navigator would surely want revenge of some sort.So we have the problems between the navigators , the hard nosed drill instructor busting the prisoner/pilots chops ( especially Felix Stone , played by Michael Pare ' ) , and the slimy head of the station , Major Lee , played by Malcolm McDowell , another actor who spends an awful lot of time in b-movie hell . ( Check out the IMdB and you 'll see what I mean . ) The whistleblower , a navigator called Tyler , played by Devlin , gives Stone what he has and together they determine that the mysterious disappearance of the shuttles is really not that they got lost , but were misdirected by someone inside the organization . There 's some running around , some scenes that were supposed to build tension , etc. , and we start to find out the truth in what 's going on , the motive behind the theft of the shuttle . My biggest problem with this movie is that it seemed like too many threads of story line were dangled before us , much more than could be adequately resolved within the 98 minute running time of the movie . The major stuff was resolved , but the movie got bogged down in character development for characters that were not important to the main story . I mean really , who cares why the one navigator spiked some pilot 's lunch with drugs ? As a result , Malcolm McDowell and Michael Pare ' did n't get as many lines or as much screen time as they should have . The effects and sets are decent enough for this kind of movie , although they kept showing us scenes of a giant earthmoving device and I do n't know why ? To establish something , I guess ... and why do all mining bases/station of operations have to be so funky looking in these movies ? It 's not that they 're dirty , but just a lot of metal grated flooring , pipes and what not on the walls and ceiling , and extremely poor lighting . Maybe it 's a written rule somewhere.I think this could have been a better movie had it focused more on the main plot , and not presented all these secondary plots , spending a lot of time dealing with them , and basically going nowhere . And I was disappointed in the pan and scan full screen format . When will they learn ? Why not put both formats on the disc , and let the viewer choose ? And do n't look for any extras , not even a trailer or case insert with chapter stops . Nada , nil , none ... seeing as how this director went on to bigger ( but not necessarily better ) things , I would have thought he would have been interested in providing some insight to us about this movie through a commentary . Oh well ... A so so movie with an exceptionally poor release .\",\n",

But hey , even though I think it was terrible , some `` churchy '' people like the main character will watch it , and the message will minister to them . I doubt this movie was meant for anyone outside the church anyway.The ENTIRE movie was dialogue . Long , boring , completely uninspired dialogue . There are some quick short books on screenwriting that could have helped here tremendously . There are a ton of concepts that need to be communicated for anyone outside church culture to understand the story , but there was no creative attempt in conveying anything . With all the talking you had to listen to it did n't help that the sound was n't that great , either too loud , soft , or heavy echoing at times.Attempts in creative photography were utter flops , and the boom mic made a cameo appearance within the first 10 minutes . The `` fancy '' restaurant staging took away more production value than it was worth aiming for . This film simply did n't have to look as low budget as it did . Black & white flashback scenes were cliche , and some shots just left me hoping they 'll do MUCH better next time.I rented this movie from the Redbox thinking if a faith-based movie made it into the Redbox it must be pretty good . I know better now . Not only am I a devoted Christ-follower and filmmaker , I also live in the area this film was shot in , so when I say it was hard to stomach it 's for good reason .

That 's not to say a descent story could n't have been produced about the character of Rayne , but it certainly fell flat on it 's face here . The script is the first culprit . It comes off about like something I wrote in tenth grade English class . Every cliche imaginable is on display . It 's as if screenwriter Guinevere Turner had an encylopedia of banalities . I suppose the excuse could be that she is new to this sort of piece but come on . The world is non-descript and full of things incongruous with it 's old world setting . But despite said anachronisms , the dialog is nothing but stiff , old-worldy speak with a humorous aversion to contractions in sentences . The various plot machinations that provide the impetus for the characters actions always remain vague and irrelevant . There is just so little here for the actors to work with.Not that they are trying to hard . No one here seemed to give a crap , which is understandable . There is humor to be had though in the clumsy , stilted line deliveries of many of the actors . It almost seemed as if some of them , ( Michael Madsen and Michele Rodriquez most obviously ) , were reading the dialog off a cue cards for the first time . Udo Kier and Billy Zane have pointlessly tiny rolls , ( though Zane manages to ladle on some of his particular oddball qualities ) . Ben Kingsley basically sits in the same chair for three quarters of the movie , barely reacting to anything anyone says to him . And Meatloaf , well..I find myself somewhat nonplused by his short sequence in the film . All I 'll say is that was one hell of a wig.Let 's see..was there anything good ? I will say that Kristanna Loken is definately hot . It 's hard to say if she can act because there is not dialog worth reciting and no director capable of pushing her in the direction of a performance , but she definately looks like I would imagine Rayne . The gore , particularly on the Unrated version , is rather vivid , if a little clumsy and unconvincing . There 's a big troll..who 's never really explained..and..uh..ah , hell , I just wish someone would give Uwe Boll some career advice . Maybe he could be a fight scene choreographer , he likes those , or he could try his hand at being a Production Assistant , work his way back to the top , relearn how to make a movie . Heck , he could be a garbage man for all I care , someone just tell him to stop making movies . In that way , all of mankind could benefit .\",\n",

       " \"Unlike many of the previous reviewers , I had never seen this concert video before I purchased the DVD a few weeks ago . I have owned the album on vinyl for more than 20 years , and always been curious about the video which accompanied its release , but never had the opportunity to see it.Although it has its ' drawbacks , it was worth the wait to see this . The band is unbelieveable , and all the myth surrounding Jaco Pastorius makes it worth the effort to search this out . Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays are wonderful ( I love the way Lyle throws in that lick from `` Phase Dance '' right in the middle of the opening `` In France They Kiss on Main Street '' ) , and Jaco , well , words ca n't really do Jaco justice . It 's just amazing seeing all this on video - the way the band plays off each other just ca n't be adequately described.Like most of those who have written earlier , my main complaint about this is all of the old movie clips shown with no rhyme or reason throughout the concert . For me , they distracted from instead of adding to the experience.Otherwise , this is mostly excellent . Joni is very loose ( for a self-confessed introvert ) and sure of herself . It 's obvious she 's having a great time . And who would n't , with some of the best musicians in the world backing you up ? Despite the cheessy obviousness of some of the videos , this is still a top-notch DVD . The 5.1 sound is excellent , and even though there are a couple of songs from the album missing , we get a few which are only on the video - Jaco 's solo and nice version of `` Raised on Robbery '' . Good stuff .\",\n",

       " \"Before going to see HELLBOY II : THE GOLDEN ARMY , my wife and I sat down a re-watched the original HELLBOY with our 15 year old daughter , because she had not seen it . I truly enjoyed seeing the original film again after a few years , and was once again quite interested in the trials and triumphs of `` Red '' , `` Blue , '' `` Liz '' and all the others.So the next night , we went to see HELLBOY II , and frankly , I was nearly blown away . It 's a far superior movie . Everything the first film got right , this one gets right again . And what amazes me is that I 'm not really a `` superhero movie '' fan or a `` comic book '' fan ... yet I think these particular characters , as realized by Guillermo del Toro and his team , are marvelous meldings of `` mundane '' human emotions with outsized powers . Hellboy is incredibly strong , supernaturally durable and also the spawn of the devil . Yet he drinks too much , is too clingy with this girlfriend and has an all-too-human short fuse . Abe Sapien is shy and softspoken ... but he also has psychic powers and can breathe underwater . Liz is an attractive but troubled young lady who can set some pretty nasty fires just by thinking about it.You might say that X-MEN plows the same soil ... yet those films , to me , are all glossy surface level efforts . Perhaps it 's because there are SO MANY X-Men that few of them are more than assemblages of some character traits . In HELLBOY , we almost forget we 're looking at `` monsters . `` That effect is aided by the fact the Del Toro has concocted some of the most monstrous looking creatures ever seen in a mainstream film . I do n't even know what to call his creations ... they sometimes look like something from H.P . Lovecraft , sometimes like something from the Cantina in STAR WARS and yes , sometimes like creatures from PAN 'S LABRYNTH . But all his creatures are striking to look at and brilliantly executed.HELLBOY II follows the efforts of Hellboy and his gang to restore the truce that has long existed between humans and `` creatures '' such as trolls , gremlins , elves and many other far less identifiable `` fantastic '' beings . The evil Prince Nouda is essentially breaking the truce with man , and intends on ridding the earth of them forever by bringing back to life an army of 4900 giant robots than simply can not be destroyed and setting them to rampage through our cities.So often , stories like this just are n't terribly interesting , but I have to say that this one kept me going throughout . Much simply had to do with the imagination with which all the beings are presented . In an early , very striking scene , the Prince confronts his elderly , elf-like father . When the old man dies ... his body turns into a stone statue . I know we 've seen this kind of effect before ... but the feeling this transformation evokes is a lovely mixture of awe at the beauty and dread at the finality of the change.But thankfully , the world has Hellboy to protect it . He charges into the fray , barely understanding what 's going on , but hellbent to kick some butt ! ! His crush first , ask questions later attitude gets him into trouble , of course ... but also wins the affections of the audience . He 's like a little kid with some big powers . His is somewhat domesticated by his fiery girlfriend ( their relationship has progressed in surprising ways over the years ) ... but he still ca n't help letting his big arm fly ! The crew is joined by a new `` leader '' in the form of Johann Krauss , an entity made entirely of gas ! Krauss animates an old-fashioned diving suit in order to give himself some shape ... but his powers ( and his Teutonic arrogance ) give the movie a nice jolt . He 's a completely new creature . Not physically strong like Hellboy or empathic like Sapien . He 's smart and he knows some pretty cool ways to use his gaseous state ! He and Hellboy have what amounts to a locker-room showdown that had me and the entire audience in stitches.I see that I am just going on and on in my review . There 's so much more I 'd like to share ... but I hope you at least get the gist that this is a highly entertaining and worthwhile film . Del Toro is a visionary director . But I would be remiss if I did n't mention that the film is truly made wonderful by the fully-realized and heartfelt performance of Ron Perlman as Hellboy . He 'll never get an Oscar for a part like this ( not that he should ) ... but he gets a Summer Movie Season of 2008 MVP award for his very charismatic turn . Selma Blair has never looked better . Doug Jones ( Abe ) is wonderful in his physicality and the always enjoyable John Hurt even makes an early , welcome appearance . Only Jeffrey Tambor ( normally so good ) comes off poorly as their befuddled boss . His part is actually written to make him too much of a buffoon , so he 's actually only irritating most of the time.In the best sense , I felt swept away by this film . I am quite eager for Part III ! !\",\n",

       " \"As a fan of 'Gargoyles ' for nearly seven years I am excited to see our beloved 'Gargoyles ' come on DVD after having the release date pushed back on us several times.What may have started out as just another traditional cartoon became a well loved favorite and it has developed a faithful and ever growing fanbase over the years even to this day . For me it took one episode and I was hooked on the show . Then a few years later I rediscovered the show and joined the internet fanbase . 'Gargoyles ' follows a clan of Scottish gargoyles that wake up in modern day New York City after their ancestral home is bought and reassembled atop a New York building while they slept via a magical spell that would only break when the castle rose above the clouds . The clan faces many challenges , including adapting to a new era and their new city they swore to protect and hoping to be accepted by the people of their new city . They meet and make human friends along their way , including NYPD cop Elisa Maza who becomes close with them all , especially their leader Goliath.The show 'Gargoyles ' has something for everyone- mythology , a hint of romance , adventure and even some Shakespeare .\",\n",
       " \"The Tiger Blade , in its first five minutes , began with promise . It opens up with a frenzied shoot-out in a hotel room that really grabbed me . The trouble is , as soon as the scene ended , the film loosened its grip abruptly and let me fall flat on my face.My biggest complaint is as follows : The entire advertised premise of the movie -- that of a hero using a legendary magical blade ( THE TIGER BLADE ! ! ) to defeat otherwise invincible enemies -- is almost ENTIRELY non-existent . Seriously , this sword gets about five minutes of screen time . Four and a half minutes ( if that , honestly ) are taken in retrieving it , then there 's about two fifteen second fight sequences with it . Okay , so I 'm not counting the four or so times it 's mentioned in dialogue , pushing it to a nice round five minutes and five seconds of mention in the entire film that IT 'S NAMED AFTER ! The TIGER BLADE of the title is barely in this movie , and what 's more it 's COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY to be there in the first place ! The story boils down to this . A freedom fighter escapes from prison to act out a plan that will help him support his cause back home . Some dudes working for the government want to stop him.There were also more subplots than I could keep up with , characters and names kept popping in and out of the story and dialogue , and basically if I attempt to make sense of ANYTHING in this movie I simply CAN'T.And why bother including this TIGER BLADE scenario if ONLY ONE ENEMY IS GOING TO ACTUALLY DIE FROM THE SWORD ? I 'm sorry , I 'm really hung up on this point . So I 'll move on.The action , outside of that opening gun battle , was completely uninspired too . Typical kung fu , jumping around , dodging , blocking , kicking , etc . There was a very creative GO-KART chase on a highway moving around semi-truck trailers and such which would fit great in a Stephen Chow film , but this was near the end of The Tiger Blade and there had been no concessions to any kind of comedy up to this point so I just have no idea what anyone working on this film was thinking.The Tiger Blade was a completely unfocused film in every way . It 's rare that I get fired up over a bad film , but being lied to in the premise has really got me going . I watched this movie expecting an action film with a mystic twist full of strange enemies and over the top action . Instead I got a mishmash of a cop film with a bunch of extraneous nonsense and garbage tacked onto with a mere MENTION of mysticism which somehow earned its way into the forefront of the film 's advertisement even right down to its title.Even if it had been titled correctly , and if the bit about the sword had n't been embellished to make it seem as if it actually comprised the entire movie , The Tiger Blade would have still been awful . I just would n't have been tricked into watching it .\",\n",
       " \"The Abyss is a great sci-fi movie of it 's time , and one of my favorites.But- The point of this review is to show that in 2002 , squeezing 2 versions of the movie AND special features onto 1 DVD may have been a `` money-saver '' for the studio , but to have to listen to compressed 2-channel Dolby `` Surround '' tracks is torture if you have even a half-way decent sound system . ( i.e.- not TV speakers ) The fact is- 'Dolby Surround ' is not actually surround sound . Incase you do n't know- Stereo is stereo , and if you imbed a reverse-phase track so that D. Surround decoders ( on just about every 5 speaker reciever for the last 10 years ) play audio in the rear , you 're just listening to louder sound effects that are coming also from the front 2 speakers . The center channel is just taking the mono tracks and playing them independently ( and there is more than just dialog in this ) . No `` .1 '' track included either , your sub just plays some low frequency sounds from the crappy low res audio in stereo . Barely noticeable.-Also , the video is actually a 'fullscreen ' aspect ratio with the 1.35:1 movie aspect embedded inside of it . So the result is ( even with progressive scan ) LOWER RESOLUTION THAN 480p ( technically lower than 480i on the disc itself ) Point being- even in 2002-2003 , the studio ( Fox ) could have just spent a few more cents per unit to manufacture these in 2 disc form , and there would n't be a problem . Or just not make the decision to put 2 versions of the same movie in it.GET THE COLLECTOR 'S EDITION if you like this movie , which I do . I 'm returning this one ( if I can )\",\n",
       " \"As a fan of the Battlestar Galactica series , I was really looking forward to watching Razor , in part because it was supposed to be an intro to season 4 , and in part because the series is so stunning I figured they could not go wrong . They did . Not only was this a very lackluster digression into back stories that we already knew , it seriously muddied the waters.Razor is supposed to be the story of the Pegasus . It amplifies the stories of Admiral Cain , the Cylon ( No 6 ) that had worked aboard the Pegasus , and Lee Adama 's role as Captain of the Pegasus -- all told from the perspective ( more or less ) of Cain 's assistant Kendra Shaw . The story should have given us new insights , or at least answered some lingering questions . It did neither . There was no information that was presented in this story that we did n't already know from watching the series . Going into details was not only unecessary , it some respects it actually took away from the dramatic impact of the series . ( Did we really have to know the specifics of the relationship between Cain and No 6 ? How was that important ? ) Introducing an entirely new main character , Kendra Shaw , certainly did not help . We did n't know her well enough to identify with her , and , frankly , I found her a bit dull.But the worst aspect of this film was that it ran against what we already knew about characters we had come to love and respect . The first rule of writing ( one of the many first rules ) is that you protect your characters . You can kill them , but what you ca n't do is destroy their integrity , especially not for the sake of a plot contrivance . Admiral Adama 's integrity was seriously compromised at the end of Razor , and for no good reason . The story simply was n't significant enough to warrant tarnishing the strongest character of the series.If you skip Razor , you will have missed nothing . In fact , you might even enjoy the rest of the series more if you do .\",\n",

       " \"This movie has been called `` Dead Poets Society for girls '' , and while there are strong similarities between these two movies , Mona Lisa Smile stands on its own . Julia Roberts plays Katherine Howard , a `` California bohemian '' who comes to Wellesley College to teach History of Art to a group of ( mostly ) spoiled rich girls who are there just biding their time until they get married . She intends to change this by making them see they can do whatever they want to do with their lives , not just someone 's wives.Of course , trying to change tradition and the College 's establishment does n't come cheaply , as she is seen by her students as someone not worthy ( why is n't she married ? ) and as someone dangerous by the school 's governing body . She does n't follow tradition , does n't obey the rules and has what they call unorthodox ways of teaching , like taking the girls to see modern art and not following the curse 's syllabus.As time passes and the girls get to know her , things start to change , and by the end of the movie everyone has learned a valuable lesson in life.One of the main differences between this movie and Dead Poets Society is that it mainly follows Katherine 's life , leaving the students ' lives as secondary stories , while in DPS it 's the other way around . We do however share some moments with some of the other characters , namely Betty Warren ( Dunst ) , the bratty , spoiled girl who despises Katherine and her ways , Joan Brandwyn ( Stiles ) , who is somewhat torn between life as a housewife and going to Law school , Connie Baker ( Goodwin ) , whose not as beautiful as the other girls and only dreams of finding love , and Giselle Levy ( Gyllenhall ) , the wild , sexy girl . Most of the movie , however , centers on Katherine 's struggles both on and off campus , as she starts a romantic relationship with the school 's Italian teacher ( West ) .Set in the 50 's , this movie deal mainly with the subject of liberation and equality , its message being that women can be all they want to be , not only wives.The acting in the film is solid , starting with Roberts , but the real standouts are the girls . Dunst does mean and bitchy very well , and Stiles gives another good performance , but the two shining characters are Goodwin and Gyllenhall . Marcia Gay Harden , as the repressed Nancy Abbey , the school 's teacher for `` how to behave in society affairs '' and Katherine 's house mate .\",\n",

Instead that story , of a young woman with a mental illness and her relationship with folks in a church , leads us . It was only as I reflected on the experience of the film that I realized how much information it really contained.The links between homelessness and mental illness are strong . My research is into food and housing for the homeless and barely sheltered , so I encounter this topic every day in my work , but no matter how many times I try to EXPLAIN the links , I usually fail to make sense of this topic for my listeners . I think I 'll just give it up and show this film instead.But an equally compelling , and lovely , aspect of this work is the depiction of one community 's ( in this case a Catholic church 's ) sensitive , pervasive , and deeply good engagement with the woman they found literally on their doorstep.The film walks a fine line , allowing us to sense the emotions of her family and of those who cared for her , but avoiding sentimentality.Occasionally there 's a bit much talking head , reading , and streetscape , but these are most likely evidence of a narrow budget , because overall , the cinemetography and editing are both very well done . The film never lags.My only major quibble is with the ending , which I wo n't spoil for you . It pushes somewhat too far in suggesting a particular explanation . Another explanation serves equally well , one which includes the fact that Ms. Wiltsee 's diet would unquestionably have weakened her bones . This explanation , however , would be less comforting than the one offered . Perhaps that 's OK , under the circumstances.Overall , entirely worth watching .

Young Peter yearns to break loose from beneath the control of his stern father Jethro ( Mitchell Ryan ) , who operates the trading post on the North Platte River , and when an opportunity comes to be an Express rider , he takes it despite the disapproval of his sire . Peter has trained his own mount , an erstwhile Pawnee stallion he has named Domingo , and after he begins employment as a rider , the youth is propelled into manhood through a series of exploits . Based upon Marguerite Henry 's novel for young readers , the work is filmed in New Mexico and benefits from some first-rate production values , in particular those pertinent to matters of historical research , and is photographed very effectively in Panavision ; however , a torpid tone is maintained throughout and deployment of a small , illy conditioned crew of `` Indian '' extras is not useful . Although there are fine turns contributed by John Quade as the post blacksmith , Milo O'Shea as an eccentric surveyor and , notably , Ryan with a fascinating reading as the tormented senior Lundy , the affair flags whenever the androgynous Garrett is onscreen , because he simply does not convince as a stalwart pioneer lad .\",\n",

I really feel like it works -- I 've noticed a big difference in the muscles in my legs after using this program regularly . Also , the program is a nice length . It also stretches my capacities just enough to be challenging , but not so much that I ca n't do it . I really recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a yoga program that pushes them a little harder and is more of a `` workout '' than some others . I also recommend it to people who have some practice with yoga already , not people who are just starting out .\",\n",
       " \"Set in Belgium , this unusual thriller has as its protagonist an anti-hero -- a 57-year old hitman who 's beginning to experience symptoms of Alzheimer 's . His brother , older and residing in a nursing home , has an advanced form of the same disease . But the hitman , Angelo Ledda , has enough of his wits about him to know what 's going on ; he does have some slips in memory from time to time , though , and these throw him off , to some extent at least , in the context of remembering what he 's just done or where he just was -- or who he might have just executed.The acting is superior ; this in combination with a smart storyline with sharp dialogue makes for an engrossing two hours . As is true of many modern noir tales , this one involves corruption in high places , as a result of which murders ensue -- some committed by Ledda , some not.The pacing here is pretty much flawless . The back and forth between the cops , the hitman , and the evil higher-up guys is spot on . This is a great companion piece to the recent French policier `` 36 Quai des Orfevres '' directed by Olivier Marechal which , unfortunately , is not available on DVD here in the US , but is available in a non-region 1 European DVD release.Highly recommended .\",\n",
       " \"the 100 minute original US release deserves 5 stars , this one gets 0 ( but amazon made me give at least one star ) . here 's why : **SPOILER ALERT**the rearranging of the first few scenes in the film kinda bothered me , but not that much . i guess i just was n't used to it playing out that way . i gave it the benefit of the doubt at first , then ... .the first thing that REALLY stood out as being a bad edit was the chunk of scene that was removed after the ship started sinking . he cut out when they hit the sea floor and noticed it was peculiarly shallow . in doing this , one of my favorite bits was removed `` how deep IS the ocean ? '' `` very deep ... .usually '' . that scene was essential . if you were in a panic about your ship sinking into the ocean , and all of a sudden it was n't , you would comment on it , right ? ! it only got worse from there ... this was the worst part : he cut dialogue and left the scenes in ! the second half of the edge of the world scene looked like helen keller edited it . the dialogue track was removed and you SEE the yelling back and forth of lines between tim and imogen , but only hear background noise . then the middle of one of her lines was crappily tacked on at the end . it was painfully obvious that it was n't what she was actually saying . no effort was made to match it up . unacceptable . they really should have just re-released the original . i did appreciate the sharper picture and widescreen format on the dvd , but other than that , it should have been left as it was . in trying to make the story more concise , he hacked it to nonsensical peices .\",\n",

Unfortunately , the remastered version now has new music playing during familiar and popular scenes , causing the tone and mood to be thrown off balance with the rest of the movie .

A compelling movie from beginning to end with its fast , furious dialogue , great performances all round and shocks along the way , especially towards the end of the film .

       " \"It was the franchise slugfest fans thought would never happen except in comic book form . After years and years of failed attempts and false starts , the powers that be finally got it together . Hoping to capitalize on the surprise success of the merging of two successful horror franchises with Freddy vs. Jaso , two of science fiction 's most popular creatures go toe-to-toe in Alien vs . Predator with those pesky humans caught in the middle.There 's not a clich & eacute ; that this film does n't like . The disposable characters are broadly sketched . For example , a bottle cap worn around a character 's neck is considered a defining trait . The film even manages to include that old chestnut where characters outrun a fireball explosion.Fans waiting for the two alien races to start slugging it out will have to wait almost an hour until their first battle but it is pretty impressive as they toss each other around like something out of a comic book . Admittedly , the fight scenes are pretty cool in all their CGI-assisted glory but this is hardly an endorsement.Poor Lance Henriksen is slumming it here as an egotistical businessman who provides the only human link to the other Alien films ( it is hinted that he is the inspiration for the Bishop android in Aliens ) . He 's only in maybe a quarter of the film before being quickly dispatched.There is an audio commentary by writer/director Paul W.S . Anderson and actors Lance Henriksen and Sanaa Lathan . They plug along gamely seemingly oblivious to the narrative mess that is this movie.Also included is an audio commentary by visual effects supervisor John Bruno and creature effects designers Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr . Anyone who likes to listen to these kinds of details will find this track informative.There are three deleted scenes totaling two minutes and include a little bit of Predator humour that was rightly cut.Also included are two trailers and a gallery of the comic book covers to Dark Horse 's Alien vs . Predator series.Alien vs . Predator was not worth the wait and fans of the comic book will feel cheated . The film starts off slow but once the Aliens and the Predators start pounding each other the weak script and clumsy plotting fades mercifully into the background . It 's a shame because both of these alien races are ripe for countless story ideas that subsequent sequels have not been able to capitalize on effectively . All we are left with is a good looking , paint-by-numbers movie .\",\n",

       " \"I bought Waitress because I 'd heard that it was a feel good movie . A waitress in a pie diner dreams of escaping her jealous , needy husband by winning a pie contest and using the reward money to run away , but her dreams fall apart when she finds out she 's pregnant . She starts an affair with her new doctor and finds happiness . Sounds nice , right ? Well , it really is n't . Both the doctor and waitress are cheating on their spouses in that sort of 'let 's not discuss this because I 'm never leaving my wife ' way . I felt hurt that the waitress 's only happiness came from an affair with a man who did n't love her enough to be with her . The darkness of the affairs , the unwanted pregnancy and a list of other unhappy relationships from the surrounding characters makes you feel defeated . For a happy , feel-good movie you walk away feeling like nothing really ended the right way.I 'd avoid this one unless you approve of unhappy relationships and a plethora of affairs and cheating .\",\n",
       " \"Martin Scorsese was honored with by the Cannes Film Festival as best Director in 1986 for his brilliant dark comedy After Hours . It is an amazing and immensely funny film which features an absolutely amazing performance by Griffin Dunne and great supporting performances by many up-and-comers .

The story is simple and very clever , with Paul Hackett ( Griffin Dunne ) , a boring word processor , who meets an interesting but odd girl ( Rosanna Arquette ) in a coffee shop . Returning home , he decides to call her , and he is invited over to the apartment . Paul does n't know it , but he is about embark on an incredible journey through `` after hours '' New York , where all the weirdos ( ... ) are free to roam . The weirdos ( ... ) include Cheech and Chong , Teri Garr , Linda Fiorentino , Verna Bloom , Catherine O'Hara ( In her first film appearance ) , and John Heard . Bronson Pinchot gives a memorable cameo as an ambitious word processor in the beginning of the film . You will love this film , especially the shocking finale . Scorsese is the best !\",\n",
       " \"Like some of the other disappointed reviewers , I had high expectations of Minority Report going into the theater . Spielberg is given lots to work with . The concept of precrime has enormous potential , and I was interested in how Spielberg 's vision of precrime could blow me away in the theaters.The concept is completely wasted . As mentioned in many earlier reviews , there are plot holes that wreck the film , and the movie leaves a critical viewer distressed.It was a movie that actually got worse as I thought about it after leaving the theater , hoping to discover the plugs that fill in the plot 's holes , I only realized that there were obvious logical impossibilities that can not be resolved . It is so frustrating to have a plot that is somewhat confusing , and upon further review , never actually comes together.Watching a movie like Pulp Fiction , 12 Monkeys or Memento , where events are seen out of order and pieced together until a full picture can be seen and appreciated , is far more satisfying than watching this film , in which events are seen out of order ( through the Precogs ) and pieced together to create a complete picture which could have never actually happened.Not only is the concept of precognition wasted . A significant suspension of disbelief is required to conceive of a futuristic world where murder can be prevented completely , but the most important female 'Precog ' can be kidnapped by a wanted criminal from the friggin ' police headquarters ! Does n't this frustrate anyone else ? You never really appreciate why the real villain committed the actual crimes that seem superfluous to the original plotline of Cruise running from the police for a crime he has not yet committed.So many films involving non-sequential events or time travel create a fascinating illusion of reality that bends and twists into a wonderful and satisfying conclusion that is unlike anything that could have been anticipated.The more I think about this movie , the more frustrated I am with Spielberg . It seems he blew what could have been a fantastic concept for a movie . Some of the effects are fun to watch , but you expect Spielberg to have had a much better handle on the plot .\",\n",

       " 'This movie looked like a very safe bet , a thriller with actors of the caliber of Berry and Willis could not be half bad , right ? Wrong ! I was so disappointed by this movie that it is not even funny . The first thing that struck me was how bad the dialogues were . It is hard to believe somebody actually took the time to write these lines without trying to make them seem illogical on purpose . And talking about illogical , what about the ending ? The final twist comes so far out from left field that I thought it was a joke , and even worse , it really makes little sense with the rest of the plot.I have a hard time believing that the Halle Berry I saw in this film is the same actress that won an Oscar a couple of years ago . Her performance was disastrous , and the way in which she delivered her lines was completely wooden . Maybe she had a hard time dealing with the outright bad script , but that can not be an excuse . Especially because when you look at Bruce Willis and even Giovanni Ribisi , you see that these two actors overcame the low quality plot and delivered performances that at least were good enough to be believable.The story starts out as a good idea ; a reporter ( Berry ) is trying to prove that ad mogul Harrison Hill ( Willis ) is the culprit in the murder of her childhood friend . The problem is that the plot quickly loses traction and the ending makes it all come tumbling down in flames . Stay away from this one at all cost !',\n",

' and 'Cocoon ' ) has done it again with his ultra-hip thriller 'What Lies Beneath ' . This time , though , he 's in Hitchcock territory , plying us with close-ups of gurgling bath plugholes , torn shower curtains and oh-so-paranoia inducing camera angles that really do become increasingly unnerving . Noted composer Alan Silvestri ( a Zemeckis favourite ) wrote the film 's nail-biting score ( see your knee jerk with every orchestra hit ! ) while Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer offer lively performances as an average , all-American couple whose 'little dilemmas ' are n't quite what they seem ; 'What Lies Beneath ' looks at the potentially murderous passions that boil beneath the facade of neatly washed cars and well kept gardens . And all this is set against a backdrop of sinister supernatural goings on . The special effects ( though you wo n't really notice them ) are chilling ; the bath that fills itself up , the front door that wo n't stay locked , and the strange face we catch for fleeting moments lingering in the depths of the black and discomforting lake at the back of their house demand you do n't watch this film alone ! Slick , fast-paced and rarely allowing you to come up for air , 'What Lies Beneath ' is guaranteed not to disappoint .\",\n",

But if one can get beyond that , it 's most definitely worth a watch.That said , this DVD transfer is basically UNWATCHABLE . It 's not clear what source they used for the transfer , but there are TERRIBLE audio pitch problems throughout the movie , with wow and flutter horribly apparent . This is particularly problematic for a movie like this with a significant orchestral and vocal score .

Dennis Hopper was a wonderful villain and the characters are very likable.I want to give thumbs way up for the audio portion of the Blu Ray - turn up the sound when you are watching this because the quality is truly stunning . Very realistic , nothing exaggerated . Dialog is clear and the movie makes good use of a surround system . The video is good , considering the age of the movie .

However , we are also highly sensitive to the distance from reality in most of these movies , and this one kept us awake and interested . Crazy/Beautiful may be another fairly tale reworking of the star-crossed lovers theme , but it also presents its characters with a gritty realism . These kids in this movie are a lot like real kids that we know and see everyday . Kirsten Dunst is still portraying a teenager , but proves she can handle adult complexity . Jay Hernandez is wonderfully unaffected . The story is in many respects by the numbers , but it turns most of the movie cliches upside down - the rich kids father approves of the poor kid - it 's his own daughter he has trouble with . The Latino kid is appealing to the white girls , but he is n't a white boy in a Latino skin , he is comfortable in his identity . I do n't want to say too much more because I do n't want to ruin the story for those who have n't seen it.This is a fun film to watch with superb performances . As others have said , it has no villains just people who look like them from the vantage of the main characters . It 's a feel good teen movie with something to interest the brain .\",\n",

       " \"The packaging on this DVD set is not perfect , but the abundance of `` Extras '' is astounding . The interviews and documentaries where incredible , taking their time , and being a very thorough dissection of the events and decisions leading up to the ultimate theatrical releases of each of the movies . I found the making of Alien and Alien 3 the most interesting of the documentaries.Of course , I have a bias towards liking the documentary for Alien because it is by far my favorite of the four movies , but Alien 3 's was equally interesting because it showed the corporate decisions that hindered the ability for David Fincher , in my opinion one of the great cinematic directors today , from making a movie that could captivate its audience . True , Alien 3 did n't live up to it 's genre expectations-true , it was n't scary , but it was a visual treat and the mood and desolate atmosphere invoked by the movie is notable . I think in time , people will come to regard it as an sci-fi art film-certainly not the best Alien film if you 're a sci-fi or horror buff , but in my opinion should n't be written off as an awful film ( and I 'm very picky ) .The special editions of each of the movies where better than the theatrical releases , except Alien Resurrection which was more interesting than wholly necessary . Although Alien 's theatrical release was n't as good as the special edition , I prefer it because I like the long meandering shots that Ridley had of the ships ( notably missing in the SE version ) as it adds a emptiness to the feel of the ship-space is supposed to be cold and quiet.This is my judgement of the four movies ( special editions ) :1 ) Alien - Perfect and brilliant . The new shots of the Alien are great if suttle.2 ) Aliens - One of the best action movies ever . The additional scenes interrupt the tension a little and make the movie really long , but still very much enjoyable.3 ) Alien 3 - Gothic and somewhat depressing , but is interesting despite not being truly frightening-it 's hard to care for murderers and rapists being picked off by a dog-like alien . Fincher scenes Fincher was forced to take out really helped the movie a great deal . The SE version is better than the Theatrical Release.4 ) Alien 4 - Designed for Teenagers . This feels the most like a Holliwood movie with one liners that the first Alien movie would dare use-almost a parady of itself . It makes a good summer flick , but not exactly repeatable , and definitely pales in comparison to the first and second , and even the third.The Worst parts of all 4 movies put together would still be like Citizen Cane compared the abortion of a movie , Paul Anderson put out this summer `` Alien Vs . Predator ''\",\n",

Also I liked how the movie addressed how often Satan is n't even seen as real.But I could n't give it more stars as it seemed disjointed and the acting was horrible and the writing even worse . I 'm sure everyone who worked on this project put in a ton of effort but it 's one of those movies that makes Christians look pitiful , really , that we do n't know how to relate to people where they are really at . In my opinion it only scraped the surface of peoples ' real struggles in experiencing evil on our planet , so came off as superficial and , well , unintelligent and , patronizing - which is what much of the world expects from us . I know these are harsh words but sometimes I think movies/projects like this can do more harm than good - solidifying the stereotype non-Christians can have of us and our message .\",\n",
       " \"Michael Jackson 's heartbreaking death drew me , like so many others , to his music . Rediscovering familiar songs & videos was fun , but most meaningful to me has been acquiring an appreciation for the songs I was not as familiar with . Earth Song tops the list . The music video is hard to watch because it shows man 's overwhelmingly cruel treatment of animals and the rape of the earth & rainforests , no doubt due to greed . I believe the song and video are pure Michael Jackson genius . The music is not only beautiful but haunting , and it sticks in your head -- along with the causes it promotes . It will move you to tears , and leave no doubt Michael put his heart and soul into crying out about these atrocities . It is a lasting , forever gift ( along with all of the rest of his music ) that he gave to us in his effort to make the world a better place . The best gift we could give back to him in return , would be to DO something -- however large or small , to stop the cruel slaughtering of animals & horrific destruction of earth & rainforests .

We both experienced the phenomenon of `` Thriller '' in the early 80s , as teens , but I doubted this could capture that same excitement . `` This is It '' was a wonderful surprise . We get a close up view of the planned tour in its final days of rehearsal . We hear the enthusiasm of the dancers , and marvel at their abilities . All of them , of course , are inspired by Michael himself , and the King of Pop delivers here , showing that he had lost none of his form even in the days before his death . He pops , locks , sings , squeals , with all the energy I remembered . There are a few stumbles , which is why they call it a rehearsal , but overall , I felt I was catching the vibe of the intended show.Not only do we get an intimate look at the rehearsal process , with some incredible effects for `` Thriller '' and others , we hear some of Michael 's creative process . Particularly impressive , in light of today 's tendency toward pretaped sounds and music , the entire show is done with a cast of musicians on stage , producing tight sounds and heart-pounding beats.If you 're looking for insights into Michael Jackson 's death , you 'll find none of that here , but if you 're looking for his passion , imagination , and musical skills , `` This is It .

The film is made to look like a horror movie that was made in the late 70 's into early 80 's . The film feels gritty . The picture quality is grate and the sound only adds ( Some sounds are taken out of edited versions . ex : the circular saw scraping bone ) . It 's gritty in the way that it plays out . YOU really feel the tension . Trust Me.The effects go back to the basics of latex and silicone ( Thank god ) . In this world of new horror movies using extremely fake 3d graphics it 's nice to see some people still believe in the purist approach .

       " \"Let me preface this by saying that I am a HUGE fan of The Hobbit by Rankin/Bass . I own it on VHS and have watched it over 100 times . It ranks among my favorites of all time . That 's the VHS version . Now let 's talk about the DVD version . It [ is not good ] ! Buy The Hobbit on VHS but avoid the DVD version . How can this be you ask ? Let me answer that by quoting the letter I wrote to Warner Bros about the DVD : '' Dear Sir or Madam : '' I have been a huge fan of the Rankin/Bass production of `` The Hobbit '' since it was first shown on television in 1977 . As soon as it was available on VHS , I bought it . I have watched it well over 100 times . I know every word of dialog and every bit of the music . It ranks among the very best animated films ever . `` So imagine my delight when I learned that it was available on DVD - finally ! ... I bought the DVD anyway ( after a long wait and a lot of pondering ) in hopes that perhaps the problems had been addressed in a newer version . Much to my dismay , the problems are even worse than the reviewer lead me to believe . It sounds to me like the original sound-effects track is completely missing . To compound such an egregious omission , new sound effects have been plopped in that do not remotely mesh with the original soundtrack . `` This is outlandish ! This is not just incomprehensible but reprehensible ! I can not possibly express to you the degree of disappointment , nay anger , I feel over this . You can not possibly have a valid reason for such foolishness . At the absolute least , you should have simply released an unchanged version of this excellent film on DVD with some attempt at enhancing the image and sound quality . `` I was eagerly awaiting the DVD release of `` The Hobbit . '' I am incensed , ... To sum up : I love the movie ( 5 stars ) . Get it on VHS ( 5 stars ) . Avoid the DVD version like the plague .\",\n",
       " \"I 've got all the `` Soap '' DVD sets , but this is by far the worst . By the time the series came to it 's fourth season , too many good characters had left , some really dumb ones had been written in , and the plots were nothing like as entertaining as in former years . The main casualty was the loss of Robert Guillaume as Benson in the last few episodes of Season 3 , his ultra-dry wit was never equalled or replaced by the lack-lustre Saunders . Secondly we also lost Diana Canova as Corrine , who was one of the better actors among the younger generation of the cast , and had been particularly effective in several emotional scenes that featured her character.All the best and funniest plotlines such as Chester 's memory loss , Corrinne 's possessed baby , Billy and the Sunnies and Burt 's UFO abduction ( ok that one was pushing it a bit ! ) are distant memories . The dramatic stories were also much better , with Billy 's courtroom battle for custody of his daughter as a fine example . Now , with such meagre stories as Jodie being turned into an old Jewish guy and Jessica lost in the revolution , the series struggles to maintain the viewers interest.After greedily consuming all the episodes in the first three season DVDs - sometimes in batches of 3 or 4 at a time - I really could n't rustle up much interest in seeing all of the Season 4 episodes after watching the first few . With Jessica not able to interact with any of the other cast due to being lost in the jungle with the dire El Puerco , and Mary turning into an alcoholic ( what a horrible storyline to give one of the warmest and most level-headed characters of the whole show ) , you just do n't feel that this is the same story any more.If you are a fan or just want a nostalgia trip , I would recommend buying the first 3 seasons and then retiring on a high . This last DVD set does nothing but drag the series into the mud . There is n't even an end or conclusion to any plotlines , as the series was not expected to end here . And if you watch this season , you 'll know why it did .\",\n",

The main characters commit atrocities , but you 're supposed to identify with them at different times because they can be rationalized as `` victims . '' There is a bizarre point where Angelica Huston materializes and the moviemakers seem to be striving for some kind of morality play . Just when you expect a dramatic twist and final conflict resolution , the characters turn indecisive and the movie ends . It 's really weird . I have seen movies fizzle before , but this one really fizzles ! I will say however that the chase is engaging , for the first hour at least .\",\n",

It is filled with impossible , ridiculous and even painful battles in Los Angeles and vampire massacres , many with no explanation since none could be hoped for.The vampire hunting characters , one of whom we recognized as being played by a member of the cast of `` Lost , '' launch poorly conceived or planned attacks on vampires in dark ghettos . They do diametrically reversed and polar opposite things and get into harm 's way so idiotically that you , too , will be quivering then scoffing and finally puking every minute.The acting is terrible , the script is stupid , and the vampires are not even scary .

       " \"Before Kathryn Bigelow got hitched to James Cameron , she was making films that you would swear where by the hand of her future hubby . Near Dark happens to look like a James Cameron horror movie , and saying this should not discredit Bigelow because here we see a female director on flying form . Near Dark not only has Bigelow at the helm , but Eric Red produced and wrote it . The cinematographer is Adam Greenberg who got the Terminator into the film can and we also have two other Cameron favorites in the mix - Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen . So if 1980s are early 1990s Cameron is your cup of blood then Near Dark is exactly what you want to see.This movie is dirt cheap but done so well that it can only be described as a very beautiful motion picture film to look at even though it is set in the dusty mid-west . Basically it is an amalgamation of cowboys , vampires , rockers , bikers , vampire sickness and love . This could have been a really cheesy B-Movie if it was n't for such a catchy script , set design , LIGHTING ! , special effects , acting and direction . The music is the kind of early synthesizer stuff that John Carpenter would play until the wee hours of the dawn . Basically the story revolves around a farm hand that gets bit , but not bleed , and ends up bonding with a small family gang of vampires until he can prove that he can make that first kill . In meantime his dad and younger sister are combing the state looking for him . The film is not so quickly moving but like Bigelow 's `` Point Break '' there is enough substance and action here to keep you going with several extremely memorable scenes - namely the bar slaughter , a shoot out involving daylight penetrating bullet holes in the walls and the ending with a kid bursting into flames as the sun comes up . For 1987 this horror packs a punch and deserves its cult status . Bill Paxton 's character is a riot and Lance Henriksen has never looked more disfigured . The film may falter at times into very weird love scenes and some strange exsanguinations finales , but for all intensive purposes this is really a superb horror movie that is certainly worthy of repeat viewings . It is also pretty bloody at times and not for the squeamish.Near Dark gets a really big thumb up from this reviewer who has seen it plenty of times since the somewhat unnoticed cinema release . If you have not seen Near Dark and are anyway interested in the horror genre then go now to the DVD store and do not look back . Its hits that 80s horror era very nicely and you can be proud of it in your collection . A cult classic if there ever was one .\",\n",
       " \"Then we have this one . Suffice it to say , I was not happy . For example : The Death of Captain Kirk : With Kirk out of the way , no more adventures with the original crew . Even if the other characters were assembled , Kirk 's absence would be painfully obvious.The Destruction of the Enterprise-D : This was the most visible symbol of Star Trek : The Next Generation , proof that Gene could catch lightning in a bottle twice . With its destruction , the biggest example of his influence also goes up in flames.The Destruction of Data : And let 's be honest here , with that cockamamie emotion chip , the Data we all knew is dead . Data was Gene 's window on humanity , his way to view it from outside and comment on it . That window has now been shattered.The Death of Rene Picard : This is a bit more subtle , but remember the last shot in the episode `` Family '' , with Rene sitting under the tree looking up at the stars ? Once upon a time , that little boy was Gene Roddenberry , dreaming of sailing the stars in some sort of spaceship like an interstellar Horatio Hornblower . Killing Rene ( by fire , no less ! ) seems to be saying `` The dream is dead , and we 're now using the corpse to stoke our own fire . `` Couple this with the numerous , and oftentimes blatant , violations in the established continuity throughout the film , which I 'll get into later , and you have the distinct impression that the powers that be , which in this case are frequently identified as Rick Berman and Michael Piller , with Ron Moore and Brannon Braga being identified as co-conspirators ( I do n't know why Jeri Taylor is generally left off the hook ; maybe she 's given fans a better impression than the others ) really do n't give a flip about what the fans feel or what their opinions are . They just expect us to be good little Trekkies and accept whatever product they put out , regardless of quality , just because it has the Star Trek name on it . For instance,1 ) The Continuity Breaches : Scotty 's presence on the Enterprise-B ( dialogue from `` Relics '' , Act I , when Jimmy Doohan looks at Riker and says , '' The Enterprise ? I should'a known ! I bet Jim Kirk pulled her out of mothballs himself and came lookin ' for me ! '' pretty clearly established that Scotty knew nothing about what happened to Kirk , or anything about the Enterprise-B ; all of this was known to Berman , who hoped that `` no one would notice '' Shyeah ! Right ! ) , The appearance of the Enterprise-B ( remember that sculpture in the observation lounge ? That showed the Enterprise-B as a straight Excelsior class vessel ) The appearance of Data 's emotion chip ( in the two episodes in which we saw it , `` Brothers '' and `` Descent pt II '' , it was depicted as a small c-clip , and was not functional when Data , who was about to destroy it until talked out of it by Geordi , puts it away in what looks like a watch case . When we see it in Generations , it 's grown to a two-inch square contraption suspended in what appears to be some sort of magnetic field , which is generally a bad idea for computer components . Plus , instead of installing it in Data 's neck , as Dr. Soong originally intended to do , Geordi installs it in his head ! By the way , should n't one of them have notified the captain before they undertook what amounts to reprogramming the ship 's operations officer ? ) The performance of the Enterprise when attacked by the Duras sisters ( whatever happened to backup systems ? the aft torpedo tubes ? rotating the shield frequencies ? ejecting the core ? ) In my calmer moments , I 've acknowledged that if you took away the Star Trek elements from Generations , then it was a pretty good movie . Unfortunately , we ca n't do that . It has all those Star Trek elements , and that includes thirty years of baggage to lug along behind , and several million volunteer sherpas more than happy to point out where you screwed up in Scene 23.Combine these , and more ( I only touched on the highlights ) with the credibility gaps ( whoever heard of commissioning a ship that only had half her systems installed ? And about that bit about how you could n't get into the Nexus with a ship . How did Soran first get in there ? In a ship . How did Kirk get in there ? In a ship . It did n't matter that the ship was blasted around them , they were in the Nexus , which came across as the ultimate desperation device ; just throw it up on the screen , and the only explanation of why it does what it does is that it 's a temporal anomaly ( an explanation that has been sliced , diced , and turned into fifty-seven different types of pretzel by various posters on AOL and BBS 's across the wonderful land of ours ) . Even spatial rifts have to follow rules , and the Nexus violated just about every one , with the exception that it was strange . It 's impossible to be a self-respecting viewer and just accept some of this stuff . ) and you have thirty years of pretty consistent continuity tied up into a very ugly knot , and a very touching series finale overshadowed by a very confusing , muddled , and sometimes insulting , film .\",\n",
       " \"The Affair of the Necklace is an entertaining and lavish retelling of the infamous scandal , in the years just prior to the outbreak of the French Revolution , that invloved a disgraced countess , a lecherous cardinal , the Queen of France , and a fabulous diamond necklace . Hillary Swank plays the Comtesse de la Motte Valois , the daughter of a disgraced and murdered nobleman who is obsessed with reclaiming her title and her lands . Though married to a rakish philanderer , she falls in with a handsome though disreputable courtier named Rateux de Villet and the two hatch a ploy to use the rich and influential cardinal Rohan to buy the necklace , supposedly for Marie Antoinette , but in reality so that the Comtesse can use the diamonds to buy back her estate and reinstate her family 's reputation . Once the cardinal realizes he has been duped he sets out to bring down the conspirators , but before he can , he himself is accused of complicity in the affair , along with his shady and mysterious & quot ; mystic & quot ; advisor Count Cagliostro , played by an outrageously wonderful Christopher Walken . The ensuing scandal enflames the country as the public , already resentful of the extravagance and indifference of the aristocracy , blame the ostentaciously elegant Antoinette as the true architect of the affair . The resulting backlash over the scandal helps to ingnite the Revolution and sends Antoinette and Louis XVI to the guillotine . The Affair of the Necklace has its faults , but overall it is engaging and beautifully filmed , with sumptuous costumes and lavish sets . Swank is a little out of her element as the noble Comtesse , but even her American accent and sometimes cheesy dialogue can be overlooked . Walken is over-the-top but enjoyable as the charlatan seer Cagliostro , Jonathan Pryce is excellent as the sleazy cardinal Rohan , and Joley Richardson gives a good performance in her role as Marie Antoinette . This is an enjoyable piece of historic drama .\",\n",

With the release of & quot ; Apocalypse Now Redux & quot ; on DVD , my opinion has n't changed . The added scenes of & quot ; Redux & quot ; give more depth to Captain Williard 's journey , but the destination , i.e. , the termination of Colonel Kurtz & quot ; with extreme prejudice & quot ; still is somewhat of a let down . Dennis Hopper 's babbling photojournalist character seems even more ridiculous and annoying today than he did 20 plus years ago . And , in my humble opinion , Brando 's performance is way overrated .

The bad news is that misery loves company.Being dangled by red hot nipple clamps over a pit of cactus and scorpions would be less painful than sitting through this menage a trash about aliens , monsters , nefarious scientists , abducted children , a paranormal putz and Tara Reid as a museum curator . Pinch me , I must be dreaming.Better a pinch than a slap in the face , which is what this hokey poky of a film delivers . Alone in the Dark is supposedly based on an old Atari game , one that I 've never heard of . What I do remember about old Atari games was their rudimentary graphics and storylines . I doubt the film= s extended back story was even a consideration.So in order to fill in the blanks , writers Elan Mastai , Michael Roesch , and Peter Scheerer borrow and steal from other films . Better films . Films that make you realize you= re not just watching an imitation , but a really bad imitation , like Chuck Norris doing his one man tribute to Judy Garland . I 'll admit his rendition of Easter Parade had me in tears , but only because he was kicking me in the face.That 's what it felt like watching Alone in the Dark .

Alone in the Dark arrives with such a poker face its impossible to know if we= re supposed to take any of this seriously . We are , but we don= t , or more precisely , can= t. There= s no leeway in the script , direction or acting.Government conspiracies abound ( after a slavishly long opening crawl ) in Alone in the Dark , which finds paranormal investigator Edward Carnby ( Christian Slater ) teaming up with an elite group of government agents to defeat an ancient evil . As an orphan , Edward escaped the clutches of unscrupulous government agent/scientist Lionel Hudgens ( Matthew Walker ) , whose depraved experiments turned children into crossbred zombies . Now that Hudgens has found the final key to unlock the portal between dark and light , it 's up to Edward , former lover and curator Aline Cedrac ( Reid ) and commando leader Burke ( Stephen Dorff ) to save mankind.Yeah , that= s who I would call when ultimate evil decides to bitch slap humanity : two actors riding that direct-to-video rail and an actress best known for flashing paparazzi . Was this a casting decision or payback ? Director Uwe Boll ( The House of the Dead ) isn=t much help , never allowing the actors to step outside of the paper-thin box or express any emotion beyond the written word . If everyone in front or behind the camera just acknowledged the obvious , Alone in the Dark would have been a hoot . Computer-generated monsters that never seem to occupy the same frame as the actors , trigger-happy commandos , a convoluted plot that makes no sense , paper doll characters , all the trappings of a goofy good time.Too bad the folks behind Alone in the Dark didn=t fall into that trap .\",\n",

Bloom 's character remains rather noble , but his nobility blinds him to how others use him , making him appear stupid . The sound track was harder to hear than most other DVDs on our system , so I missed about half of the dialogue . No problem : the plot was predictable . The characters on the whole were flat and stereotypical ( dull ) . The producers seemed to know this , trying to cover it with a plethora of special effects .

Their comrades who have marched on to Isandlwana will whip the Zulus in a few days and the army will march back to a hero 's welcome at Capetown ! Little do they know that an unforseen turn of events will have them fighting for their lives before the day is out . This turn of events , and how the men respond to it , are the subject of the movie `` Zulu '' . As the men are going about their mundane tasks , the astounding news comes that the British force at Isandlwana has been almost wiped out . An overwhelming force of Zulus are now headed for Rorke 's Drift . Next comes the realization that it 's too late to try and escape . The oncoming Zulus are almost certainly so close that they 'd overtake them before they could reach safety . Their only chance is to use whatever time remains to fortify their little outpost and hold out until they are rescued . If all this is n't bad enough , Boer calvary refuse their desperate pleas for help , and native troops desert en masse just as the attack begins , leaving their just completed perimeter dangerously thin . But the officers , neither of whom have seen combat before , refuse to despair . Struggling against fear and self doubt , they make adjustments in the face of the enemy attack , pushing themselves and their men to the limits of endurance . The men , though aware of the seeming hopelessness of the situation , remain resolute . The Zulus , too , press on , refusing to quit even though taking terrible casualties from superior firepower . As the battle continues , truths about human character are revealed . Some of the most unlikely individuals show themselves to be capable of extraordinary heroism . Others find out how stupid and superficial their biases are when judging a persons true worth . One or two find that they ca n't stand up to the situation . In the end , the British are rescued . But the movie is n't really about victory or defeat . `` Zulu '' is a visual hymn of praise to courage , unselfishness , and dogged determination in the face of mortal danger .

       " \"2002 's `` The Bourne Identity '' is an absolutely thrilling ( if loose ) adaption of Robert Ludlum 's 1980 spy novel . Its cinematic success has launched two equally thrilling sequels to date , featuring Matt Damon as former CIA assassin Jason Bourne.A young man in a wet suit , with two bullet holes in his back , is rescued by the crew of a fishing boat in the Mediterranean Sea . The young man recovers aboard the vessel , but has no memory of who he is or how he came to be in the water . His only clue is the number of a Swiss bank account implanted in a metal tube in his hip.The man travels to Zurich and reaches the bank . His account number provides him access to a safety deposit box , filled with a variety of foreign currencies , a small pile of passports , and a handgun . The top passport is an American one , in the name of Jason Bourne , with an address in Paris . The young man goes to the American Embassy in Zurich , where the staff unexpectedly tries to apprehend him and the young man unexpectedly displays astonishing fighting skills in escaping the Embassy.Outside the Embassy , Bourne bribes a rootless young German female named Marie ( played with subtle depth by Franka Potente ) to drive him to Paris . Along the way , the two will bond over the mystery of Bourne 's identity . The mystery will deepen in Paris as Bourne realized he is the target of a murderous agency effort to clean up a mistake and as he realizes that keeping Marie alive is now a personal misssion . `` The Bourne Identity '' features fast-moving , almost breathless action , lots of spy high-tech and technique , and enough convoluted mystery for at least three movies ( and counting ) . Matt Damon nicely underplays Bourne as a confused but driven man , aware that the clock is ticking in a game he does n't fully understand . The movie narrative proceeds on parallel tracks , as Bourne flees across France , while his nominal CIA boss ( played with understated urgency by Chris Cooper ) and another CIA chieftain ( played with sweaty near-panic by Brian Cox ) throw both CIA operatives and law enforcement in his path . Clive Owen has a nice cameo as another CIA assassin ; Julia Stiles is introduced in her recurring role as a Paris operative . The climax of the movie is Bourne 's dramatic entrance into a CIA safe house in Paris , there to learn the truth about his identity . `` The Bourne Identity '' is very highly recommended as the thrilling introduction to the Bourne series . The Extended Edition features a new beginning and ending to the movie designed to the events of 9/11 , which somewhat pre-empted the Cold War context of the movie . This DVD version also features some nice extras on the making of the movie .\",\n",

The laughable part was his rationale for wanting to kill him - he wanted him to suffer for what he had done to him . Ok , so kill him - then what ? Its over . The Denzel character was a paraplegic , for Pete 's sake . He suffered from seizures , etc . How could death be more suffering than that ? I would have thought that the villan would have been MORE than satisfied to watch this daily suffering . In the end it was lame , lame , lame .

If it 's really true it would go a long way for explaining how bad his performance was , and if that 's the case , maybe the rest of the cast was quietly joining him.Anyways , I 've never played the video games , so I ca n't really compare it to that , all I can say is that as a stand alone film it was a waste of money making .\",\n",
       " \"I was extremely disappointed with this DVD and subsequently returned it . One would hope that an instructional DVD would cover topics such as how to surf cast which is more difficult to learn from a book that can only present a sequence of photographs . Instead the information covered is actually better presented in Burnley 's `` Surf Fishing the Atlantic Coast '' . Information on how to identify good fishing spots and the equipment to use does n't require a video format for effective presentation . The only action in the DVD are scenes of good ol ' boys fishing the Carolina Coast -- it was more of a travelogue from the fifties than an instructional video . Save your money .\",\n",
       " \"What 's amazing about Disney 's 4th feature , & quot ; Dumbo & quot ; , is that it is probably one of the most simple looking animated features of all time , yet it is one of the best . Proving that even the most detailed art is not required to carry a movie , most of the films backgrounds and characters are not as intricate and detailed as & quot ; Snow White & quot ; or & quot ; Pinocchio & quot ; , they are VERY simple . & quot ; Dumbo & quot ; instead relys on a good story , that I 'm sure you are fimiliar with . A simple , but rich 64 minutes telling the story of a baby elephant with big ears , that is an outcast . The reason that this movie has lasted for so long , aside from being Disney , is that everyone can relate to it , as said throughout the disc 's extras and commentary.The DVD has a good Dolby Digital 5.1 mix , but I was rather disappointed with the picture quality . It claims to have a remastered picture , but there is so much grain , and dirt throughout the feature . After what Disney DVD did for & quot ; Snow White & quot ; , I was expecting a little more for this release . The extras are great : the commentary is very informative , the concept arts are interesting , and & quot ; Celebrating Dumbo & quot ; is a good enough featurette . The only negative is that Disney Co. is continuing to ruin the classics , by attaching unnecessary sequels . Inferior by existing Disney video sequel reputation , & quot ; Dumbo II & quot ; is on it 's way. & quot ; Dumbo & quot ; , costing only $ 800,000 , saved Disney from the WWII-caused financial failures of & quot ; Pinocchio & quot ; and & quot ; Fantasia & quot ; . So it is one of the important stepping blocks of Disney 's history and one of the most enjoyable animated features of all time .\",\n",

Part of this is because the two main characters are just plain nice people . There 's SO many anime where the main characters are annoying , stupid , stubbornly clueless , rude , or any of the above . It 's not always necessary to have the main characters be clearly flawed in some way , and in this case , they are n't . If Keiichi has any flaw , it 's that he 's a bit too tentative around Belldandy , but can you BLAME him ? She IS a goddess , after all.And they still have conflicts and problems -- an important thing to remember when watching the show is that even for good people , prior mistakes can catch up with you .

       " \"I had great hope for this 4-disk video set . It was beautifully packaged in a well-designed plastic 4-disk folder which was placed in a beautifully illustrated metal can case . Unfortunately , the contents fell far short of my expectations . While it was reasonably well produced and showed much interesting footage , it suffered from a number of faults , the principal being its predominant emphasis on warfare , some of which , particularly the coverage of the First World War , was only loosely connected to aviation . During the first 100 years of aviation , major warfare entailed perhaps 10 of those years , mostly the two World Wars , yet , the first two disks are almost entirely devoted to those two conflagrations with relatively minimal coverage of the period of initial development and the development that took place between the wars , to say absolutely nothing of the post-WWII era . There always seemed to be a sense of hurry to get back to one war or another . In general , there was a lack of depth , skimming over many significant events , in the rush to get back to battle . There were errors in presentation that any aviation buff would be sure to catch , such as discussing one aircraft while showing another , sometimes even from another era . With the many thousands of hours of historic film available it 's hard to understand why the producers felt it necessary to show many of the same cuts repeatedly during several of the discussions . The sequencing was disjointed often leading the viewer to ask , `` how did we get here ? '' The third disk was devoted to space exploration . Moving from the second disk to the third suffered from some of the same sense of disjoint leaving one to think that not too much went on in aviation during the period after WWII ended . However , of the four disks , this one was , nevertheless , by far the best . With the exception of a somewhat incongruous insertion of a segment on Chuck Yeager 's historic flight beyond the sound barrier , the disk followed a timely sequence from Goddard to the moon landings , giving all of the appropriate nods to the Russian accomplishments along the way ( they were , after all , first , if not best , in many areas - first satellite in space , first man in space , first woman in space , first space station - where most other U.S.-produced histories of space flight have tended to gloss over those embarrassing facts ) . The final , fourth `` bonus '' disk was a hodge-podge of films and clips ranging from another mini-doc of Chuck Yeager , to a copy of the famous original WWII film Memphis Belle ( which , inexplicably , while originally shot in Technicolor , was reproduced here in black and white ) . Lacking depth and continuity while being obsessed with warfare did not lend itself to my finding it particularly entertaining . But that 's just me . Overall , on a scale of one to five , I 'd give it a two . Moderately interesting , a bit more frustrating . But , hey , it was only $ 29 bucks - waddya ' expect ?\",\n",
       " \"I am absolutely done watching Ben Affleck movies . He has to be the worst actor earning a Hollywood mega-million paycheck over the past decade . I made it through `` Jersey Girl '' only because of Liv Tyler . However , `` Surviving Christmas '' ( 2004 ) was just torture . James Gandalfini was okay , but does he ever play any role out of his `` Tony Soprano '' character ? Christina Applegate ( who is her agent and when will she be in a great movie ? ) was good , but it just looked like she was n't into this movie . I like Catherine O'Hara a ton ( `` Best In Show '' , A '' Mighty Wind '' , `` Home Alone '' , `` Beetlejuice '' and the old SCTV ) , and she was simply over the top in some scenes ( in a garrish way ) and dare I say I did n't like her acting in this movie . Affleck 's acting is pitifully canned and he just is n't convincing . ** FACT : This movie has the shortest period of time ( less than nine weeks ) between its theatrical debut and release on DVD/Video than any other major release film in Hollywood history . *** FACT : The production was shot without a complete script . Per Gandolfini , `` much of the film was improvised '' . What 's that tell you ? This movie should 've ended in the first 20 minutes when Gandolfini 's character hit Affleck 's character over the head with a snow shovel . 91 minutes of pure drudgery .\",\n",

After trying the 30-Day Shred and loving it , I tried No More Trouble Zones and love it , too .

       " \"There are some movies these days that just do n't stand a chance when people notice something or someone about them that they do n't like . Given today 's angst-filled audience 's hypercritical viewpoints on EVERYTHING , there are shows that could literally shine as works of Hollywood art , yet will probably be villified into obscurity . AVP ( Aliens versus Predator ) may just be one such movie.STORY-5 StarsFor any of you who are reading this review and have n't yet seen AVP , I give you fair warning that the next few paragraphs give away several spoilers and might hamper your enjoyment , so you might consider skipping over it to the next section.The year is 2004 . Low Earth Orbit . There 's an object nearby , silhouetted in sunlight and coming closer . Memories of another story come floating to the fore . That shape ... so familiar ... is it ... a queen ? It passes under your field of view and you discover that , no , it 's actually a satellite and the logo on the side identifies it as belonging to the Weyland corporation . Floating high above the Antarctic , it notices something and decides to relay that information to the satellite tracking station . The attendants check the data and find a heat bloom approximately 2000 feet underneath the ice . Nothing at all should be there . Curious ... Over the course of the next few days , a team is assembled from all over the world , including a guide , a drilling team , security and archeologists , to begin an expedition , led by CEO Weyland himself ( played by Lance Henriksen ) , whose company is a pioneer in the field of robotics , to discover what exactly this potential prize is . The only thing known about it is that it 's a pyramid of gigantic size and the markings on it suggest it may have been constructed by the world 's first civilized culture . The job is rushed , against the advice of the guide , on the assumption that other companies are on their way as well , in an effort to be the first to stake a claim.When they get there , they discover a path already made to the site that was n't there the day before , set at a perfect 30 degree angle . No one on the team understands how this can be , because there is no technology found on Earth that could possibly have dug to such a depth in that short a time . The mystery deepens.On site , they enter the pyramid and discover a sacrificial chamber , which heightens the brooding sense of uneasiness among the crew . Something dark happened here in the past . Further in , they uncover a sarcophagus bearing a lock based on the Long Count , the ancient Aztec calendar . Inside , there are three objects that nobody can identify . They look completely out of place , in that they appear much more advanced technologically than the surrounding architecture indicates they should be . Removal of these objects initiates a periodic shifting of the pyramid 's interior , cutting off the team members from each other , turning the search into a hunt for a way out to safety . In addition , the team finds that they are now being hunted by two other species of creatures , neither of which are from this world . And both of them are definitely hostile.Over the course of the movie , it 's discovered that the first species of extra-terrestrial , colloquially known as Predators , found Earth many thousands of years ago and taught humanity the rudiments of civilization . In return , they demanded subjects to submit themselves to become hosts for the second species of creature . These creatures were used as quarry for a hunt , which purpose was to usher in the Predator adolescents to adulthood ; a rite of passage in order to be accepted as full members of their specific clan . This pyramid was their ritual training ground , used for just that purpose . In the event that the Aliens got out of control ( a likely scenario given their instinctive aggressiveness ; indeed sometimes it was hard to tell who was hunting who ) , the entire site was obliterated.The Aliens end up getting out of control.The guide ( the last surviving human ) ends up teaming up with the last surviving Predator and narrowly escape the destruction of the site just ahead of the blast wave . Once outside , the human is marked with the symbol of the Predator 's clan , thereby being accepted into it , and they cooperate to bring down the Queen Alien . During the battle , the Predator is killed . His corpse is brought onboard his clan 's ship for his return to the homeworld and the human ends up going her own way , now ready for whatever the future will bring.The last scene aboard the Predator 's starship is that of the dead adolescent , lying on a slab next to a porthole looking out over the Earth.He 's at peace ... ... and then his chest suddenly ruptures outward , exposing the head of a newborn Alien . Segway into 'AVP : Requiem'.End of SpoilerThis movie and its sequel came about because of a short scene in Predator 2 , where Danny Glover 's character , Los Angeles police detective Lt. Hardiman , entered a hidden Predator clan ship in search of a member of the clan which had butchered his entire squad . On one wall , there hung several skulls ; trophies of kills that clan had made . One of the skulls was that of a warrior Alien.I remember all of the hushed whispering that erupted when that scene showed in the theater and myself thinking `` Oh yeah ! '' . Soon after , Dark Horse Comics starting running a series involving confrontations between the Predators and Aliens set in the future , when humanity had branched out to the local stars . I knew then that something was going to come of that and was n't at all surprised when AVP trailers started broadcasting during prime time tv.And yes , when I saw this movie in theaters , I enjoyed it immensely . Now that the extended cut has come out on DVD , I enjoy it even more.This movie got a bad rap because 1 . ) Paul Anderson directed it and 2 . ) there were n't a lot of big-name actors starring in it.I remind everyone that none of either the Alien or Predator movies starred first-tier actors when they originally aired ( except for the very first Predator , and that one was touted as being a 'Schwarzenegger movie ' typical of the style of 1980s shoot 'em up action films ) , yet all of those actors did first-rate jobs with the tasks they were given . 'Alien ' was Ridley Scott 's second directorial effort and 'Aliens ' was also Jim Cameron 's second time as a first-unit director . 'Alien 3 ' was David Fincher 's first feature film after a bout of directing music videos . The purpose for this was so that viewers would focus on the stories rather than who was in it . They succeeded . Despite the various negative reviews , each of the movies ( depending on which one it was ) has collected a cult following that 's stood the test of time for the past thirty years . This movie and its sequel allow both franchises to survive on their own , without having the fame factor of either Sigourney Weaver or Arnold Schwarzenegger propping them up , because the story behind each is bigger than either of the characters those two actors portray.VISUALS-5 StarsThere may be some scenes in this movie that seem somewhat cliched , but these scenes are in there to remind folks exactly which background universe the story takes place in . AVP also took the characters in the show and made them more than just faceless , nameless victims of the slaughter and I applaud the director for doing so . Some people also decry the use of CGI in today 's movies . I hate to say it ( well ... no , not really ) , but CGI is here to stay . Might as well get used to it . I personally have no problems with it . I remember the old way they used to do special effects , and the photorealistic CGI visuals look a LOT more natural in the scene . The ones in this movie look awesome . Ian Whyte , the actor portaying the main Predator , has gotten the movements of the creature down exactly . I watch this and it reminds me of Kevin Peter Hall 's movements in the original 1987 show starring Arnold.SOUND-5 StarsSound in movies these days has only gotten better with digital clarity and the score and ambient effects in this show fit both franchises to the letter.SPECIAL FEATURES-5 StarsThis DVD includes both the theatrical version and the unrated extended cut on disc 1 . The special features included on disc 2 are pretty meaty and detail the production of this movie from start to finish . It also shows the comic series AVP is based on from Dark Horse , the 'Monsters in Miniature by Todd McFarlane ' featurette and the AVP HBO special.OVERALL-5 StarsDespite what many might say , I feel that this IS a worthy addition to both the Alien and the Predator backdrops . It shows us that we may not actually be alone in this universe and what we come across out there might not be that friendly . Prepare yourselves for what you may find.Two Thumbs Up .\",\n",
       " \"and you 'll think this is a better-than-average made-for-TV ( even though it was n't ) movie , and you 'll appreciate the book even more.Let 's start with the cons : The book was set in the late 1950 's ( around 1957 , I think , and I know I 'm comparing to the book , but bear with me ) , whereas the movie is set in present-day . This presents many problems.Just an aside : `` A Walk to Remember '' by Nicholas Sparks was set in 1958 and when it was translated to the screen , it lost a lot of its charm because it was set in the present . There 's just a certain charm about time past that can not be duplicated in the here and now.Anyway , fast-forwarding the book about thirty years , it lost something . The children would have been much more innocent , but then again , Jeb Stuart Adams and Kristy Swanson were MUCH too old for the roles . I know they were supposed to be older going into the attic than they were in the book ( I am guessing Chris and Cathy are the same age going into the attic in the movie as they were coming out in the book ) , but Jeb Adams was twenty-seven , and he looked it . And am I the only one who noticed the children more resembled displaced Amish children ( Chris wears suspenders and what was with Cathy and those dowdy dresses ? ) than the Dresden dolls they were supposed to be ? These children did not look Aryan enough -- yes , they had blond ( e ) hair , though I did n't notice any blue eyes , and Cory 's curly hair made him look Jewish ( which would have been fine , if this was a story about Jewish children , but it was n't ) , neither were any of these children stunning ; they were all rather ordinary looking ( Kristy Swanson was somewhat pretty , at least before her hair got chopped off ) . Though Victoria Tennant is elegant and attractive ( but not as ) in a Grace Kelly sort of way , she looked a bit tired . As for the father , well , I imagined a much handsomer man ( think Jeffrey Hunter with blond hair ) , but oh , well.But it was the children 's ages that were worse . The twins were fine , but Chris and Cathy were post-pubescent in the movie , as opposed to pre-pubescent in the book ( though Chris is fourteen in the book , he does n't start growing hair in certain places until later ) , which explains why the children in the book held out for as long as they did before escaping . It is much easier to control a fourteen-year-old boy than a boy old enough to serve in the military.I think the worst scene of the film was when Chris and Cathy are on the bus in the daytime and Cathy is going on about how they never had a pet , about how they should have had one so they could get used to death , or some such nonsense as that , so that she would know that fathers die , even handsome , wonderful ones , too . It was so totally pointless.I also think the fact that they arrived at Foxworth Hall during the daytime and through the front door instead of in the dark of night through the back deflated some of the mystery . The cinematography could have been darker in some places , lighter in others . Instead , it always seemed like it had just rained.We are given just a glimpse of what life was like , how sunny yellow it was , before Chris Sr. 's death.I did n't really mind the ending with Corinne dying , being hung by her wedding veil , because I really do see a book and a movie made from it as two separate works of art . That 's how Margaret Mitchell felt about `` Gone with the Wind '' . Though I read somewhere a sequel was planned , I am not sure how they would have went about doing that as `` Petals on the Wind '' focused not only on Cathy 's exciting and versatile love life , but on getting revenge on her mother.Cathy 's character was just totally different in the movie ( and so was Carrie 's -- Carrie was a little spitfire in the book ) and in leaving out the incest between Chris and Cathy , it lost something . Chris was just blah and Cory was cute and all , but not much else . The female characters dominated this film.Overall , the movie was just a low-budget , lackluster production.Now for the pros : The haunting , chilling score ( I 'm still not sure how I feel about Cathy 's narrating ) , and Louise Fletcher was perfect as the grandmother . This flick is entertaining enough because when I watched it before I even knew of the book 's existence , I was intrigued . I 've watched it twice since then and have the same opinion I 've had since reading the book -- that it could have been so much better , but better had it not been done at all . What 's in my imagination is better than anything they can put on film . I 've found the best movies are made out of bad books.Watch it once or twice , maybe even a third time with a friend , but that 's about it . The book has much more readability .\",\n",

       " \"I 've been anxiously waiting to sink my teeth into this horror comedy since it arrived at my house a few weeks ago . The premise is pure genius ! It 's a movie about killer ... sheep . Amazingly the filmmakers were able to contract special effects wizards , Weta Workshops ( the lads who did work on the Lord of the Rings Trilogy ) to create the `` Were-Sheep '' designs . Did I mention it was about killer sheep ? The recipe for this film is practically flawless.Too bad the final product did n't turn out as nearly as tasty as the recipe sounded . I wanted to love this film , I really did . For the first 25 minutes I was entertained . Yet once all the sheepish mayhem began I could n't wait for it to end . The movie is simply boring . It has one simple gag ... cuddly sheep turning evil and killing people is funny . Do n't get me wrong it 's hilarious when it first starts , but the movie is a one trick pony.The paper thin plot consists of Henry ( Nathan Meister ) coming back to his family 's sheep farm to sell his portion to his older brother Angus ( Peter Feeney ) . However , Angus has been performing genetic experiments to create some form of super sheep without his brother 's knowledge . Of course said experiments go horribly wrong and the results are the evil Were-sheep ( unbeknownst to Angus ) . Toss in some hippie environmentalists , who inadvertently trigger the sheep invasion , simmer for an hour and wait for it to end . Seriously , this movie is n't meant to be scary so it needed to bring the funny . Unfortunately , after a few hilarious scenes in the first act , we are left with unfunny ( not to mention mundane ) gore effects . For all you gorehounds , I hope you like seeing sheep rip out intestines because it 's an effect that gets reused ad nauseam . The final straw was that the human sized Were-Sheep were utterly silly looking . Oh , and apparently , once you turn into a Were-Sheep all you can do is punch people in the face with a vicious right hook ( you 'll see what I mean ) . I might have been able to forgive some of this if the grand finale was extraordinary , but the resolution was pretty awful.Black Sheep desperately tries to recreate the same greatness as Peter Jackson 's earlier work such as Bad Taste and Dead Alive . This movie is nowhere near that level of entertainment . If you find basic gore gags and sophomoric farting jokes to be funny then this movie might be for you . I 'm not above low brow humor ( that 's an understatement ) but this movie bored me to tears . A great premise does not make a good movie and Black Sheep is certainly proof of that.Final Grade : D+\",\n",

You will do overhead presses while tapping your foot on top of the platform , then you will move into squats with variations , step squats , alternating side to side , pulsing , etc . Surprisingly I was quite winded by the end of this segment.The next segment is more step aerobics , this routine includes straddles , side leg lifts , over the tops into squats , lunges off the back , and press steps into tap overs . I liked this segment.The final part is more 4 limb aerobics with light weights using the step for part of the routine , though most of it is done on the floor . You will see grapevines with rhomboid pinches , step touches with bicep curls , knee lifts first on the floor , then the option to move to the step if you want.Time to start cooling down , in this segment you will see simple moves such as marches , step touches , hamstring curls , tri-stars , sambas and side lunges.Overall , I really liked this workout , it might take a few tries to get it all down but once you do it is a nice routine with variety . Lisa Kay is a pleasant instructor who seems to be having fun herself . It is better suited for beginner/intermediate levels , advanced wo n't get much of a workout with this one . I think it 's a keeper .\",\n",

       " \"Let me just start by saying that I am very open to different styles of films and different approaches . I am also a very big fan of the genres of horror or suspence . Having said that , this film basically took the approach of shooting several incoherent scenes ( since when is it terrifying to just shake the camera around and use lame camecorder type effects to create terror ) of it 's protagonist walking around or laying in bed . Trust me when I say that those who liked this film must have been drunk , and basically chalked up the shotty story to their inebriation ( sorry folks no one understands this film , even sober ) or simply trying to rectify to themselves their having wasted money and time on this movie.I wo n't go into what it 's about too much as you can read the other reviews on that . Let me say that this film fails in all of the following areas.Suspense-there is n't much suspense over the initial 45 minutes of the protagonist simply acting weird , thinking weird things , or dreaming of weird things . So what ? Story-Did these guys write this story in seperate parts , throw them together and kill their editor ? This had to be the most inchorent pile of garbage every considered a story to be on a movie screen , or tv screen for that matter . I actually looked at my watch several times and thought , `` they do n't have much time left to get to some point or go somewhere with this film . `` Acting-it was overdone and humurous ( when it was n't supposed to be ) .Direction-convinced there was no director.basically over and over during the film , my wife and I kept saying , `` this is really stupid . '' I think we finished the film as a badge of honor of sorts . We made it into a funny psuedo myster science theater-look at this pile of garbage type event.I 've only seen maybe one or two other films in MY LIFE that were this bad.I plead with the director , just because you got a camcorder for christmas does n't make you a movie maker . Not a legit one.To wrap this up , the ending of the film was such a freaking predictable letdown , that I laughed out loud , then thought back to all of the ridiculous scenes that had nothing to do with it.Actually this film did make me laugh . So it got a star for that.Should 've known better though . Any film which has it 's packaging try to explain itself so much on the back of the box probably has it 's reasons for doing so ... BECAUSE THE FILM WILL MAKE NO SENSE OTHERWISE .\",\n",

It is a definite throw back to horror films of the 70 's and early 80 's and that is a very good thing . The acting is supurb and incredibly believable .

Learning she did yoga and noticing she looked phenomenal while chasing 3 children aged 5 and younger just like I was , I asked her for her opinion on yoga for a beginner and this is the tape she gave me . ( Giving videos to the interested is now my `` philanthropy '' in her honor ! ) It took a little while for me to even try it , but when I did , I was completely blown away by yoga and have done it almost every day since Feb 1 , 2006 because it feels so good ! To me it is like a massage from the inside out . As a mother with 3 small children , I really appreciated the slow , and should I call it , sensual movements , that require surprising strength . For me with my young kids , I think I relished the thought of having the TIME to do such slow and sensual poses , but I have learned to fit it in . From this video , I got good solid instruction on basic yoga and learned how yoga enhances my life instead of being yet another obligation . I have since purchased many new videos and do yoga every day and feel like I have found the ultimate mind/body answer for the rest of my life . And by the way , I did n't even know I was searching for a `` mind/body '' answer until discovering yoga . Yoga is really good stuff and this video is an ideal place to begin !\",\n",

While it 's not quite as exciting or sensual as MOULIN ROUGE , it is very entertaining.While the storyline is predictable , the actors ' performances are authentic and compelling , especially the relationship between Paul Mercurio and Tara Morice . They have real on-screen chemistry : there is a believable sense of romantic and sexual tension that fuels their desire to win the Pan-Pacific Dance Championship.Obviously Baz Luhrmann loves using lots of saturated color and exaggerated but authentic costumes to bring the world of ballroom dancing to life for those of us unfamiliar with its rituals and triumphs . The dance sequences have to be seen : they are nothing less than incredible ! The interactions between the characters is often outright hilarious , and at times poignant . A very enjoyable and touching story -- like a fairy tale infused with lots of energy and zest for living . WONDERFUL ! ! !\",\n",

A very poignant moment indeed.So , if you 're an original series fan like me and want the perfect companion piece to all of the original crew movies then this two disc special re-release is for you .\",\n",

They 're both brilliant genetic researchers who were on the break of fame for creating two genetically spliced creatures named Ginger and Fred that were the products of DNA from a multitude of organisms . What a fricken great idea ; an idea that is explored in many great novels , movies , videogames , etc. , and the idea in Splice falls extremely short of great . Well , to complicate the story , Sarah Polley injects human DNA into the same sort of organic base that Fred and Ginger were created from . . . and of course the organism would turn out to be humanoid . . . At this point there 's potential for a great Frankenstein-esque tale . . . But no , it just turns into a sick , demented , bestiality , incest tale with no climax , no imagination , and with no likeable characters.I can not recommend this film as a good science fiction-horror ; I can almost recommend this film as a decent softcore-bestiality with a hint of incest at the end .

The quality of the video is poor . The glare and shadow prevent you from identifying the fish , the type bait , the tackle , the fishing conditions , etc . Forget any hope of a demonstration of rigs , techniques , etc . In fact , it is my opinion that this video is almost completely devoid of any useful information or entertainment value . The 52-53 minute video is divided into two parts.Part One finds the charter captain and two customers , Jim and Howard , on the waters of the Gulf . The charter captain seems competent enough and his very brief demonstration of bait fish collection with a trolled net and his brief discussion of tide changes when fishing a pass are , perhaps , the only useful tips . Sadly , you will rarely hear from him . Instead you are inundated with Jim 's ( Jed Clampett with Stooge 's Larry haircut ) constant drivel . Jim presents as a selfish , irritating man who treats grinnin ' Howard like an unemployed , idiot son-in-law . Jim imparts no fishing knowledge that I could discern and will not shut up . I could not fish with such a man and would seriously entertain thoughts of pushing him from the boat . You can not even enjoy this video on mute . Part Two introduces you to & quot ; Lady Angler - Kate Jackson. & quot ; Deceptively not the & quot ; Angel & quot ; and & quot ; Angler & quot ; is a real stretch . She does not make any meaningful contribution to this video . I believe women anglers will find her insulting and sterotypical . She squeals when the fish pull , has no fishing rod technique , complains of how hard it is to reel in her fish , and has on far too many clothes to even be a pleasant diversion . I know people who fish to avoid such irritating companionship.I would prefer to have the dentist perform a root canal without an anesthetic than to see the cover of this video , much less watch it .

No wonder it was nominated for over half a dozen Academy Awards.The DVD quality was virtually flawless , but for one isolated instance that seemed a one second overlap in splicing which , for a 17-year-old film , is entirely inconsequential . Somehow without the use of special effects and modern CGI , the director and all his technicians created exceptionally brilliant scenes that seemed entirely real and vivid .

The concept of precrime has enormous potential , and I was interested in how Spielberg 's vision of precrime could blow me away in the theaters.The concept is completely wasted . As mentioned in many earlier reviews , there are plot holes that wreck the film , and the movie leaves a critical viewer distressed.It was a movie that actually got worse as I thought about it after leaving the theater , hoping to discover the plugs that fill in the plot 's holes , I only realized that there were obvious logical impossibilities that can not be resolved . It is so frustrating to have a plot that is somewhat confusing , and upon further review , never actually comes together.Watching a movie like Pulp Fiction , 12 Monkeys or Memento , where events are seen out of order and pieced together until a full picture can be seen and appreciated , is far more satisfying than watching this film , in which events are seen out of order ( through the Precogs ) and pieced together to create a complete picture which could have never actually happened.Not only is the concept of precognition wasted . A significant suspension of disbelief is required to conceive of a futuristic world where murder can be prevented completely , but the most important female 'Precog ' can be kidnapped by a wanted criminal from the friggin ' police headquarters ! Does n't this frustrate anyone else ? You never really appreciate why the real villain committed the actual crimes that seem superfluous to the original plotline of Cruise running from the police for a crime he has not yet committed.So many films involving non-sequential events or time travel create a fascinating illusion of reality that bends and twists into a wonderful and satisfying conclusion that is unlike anything that could have been anticipated.The more I think about this movie , the more frustrated I am with Spielberg . It seems he blew what could have been a fantastic concept for a movie . Some of the effects are fun to watch , but you expect Spielberg to have had a much better handle on the plot .\",\n",

This device is used to express the confusion and blind rage of a father which transforms into sadness with a feeling of closure .

One can see a progression from & quot ; The Underneath & quot ; to & quot ; Out of Sight & quot ; to & quot ; The Limey & quot ; . The genre of film noir in broad daylight seems to be uniquely his .

Together with his son Bill , Jones has shortened scenes , limited our access to those fine performances , altered the running order of the film , botched the soundtrack ( in several sections entire conversations have been removed , leaving characters ' mouths moving with no sound at all coming from them ) , removed some of the better jokes , and on the whole pared down the film to 79 minutes.You read me right - fully 25 % of the film was chucked to the cutting-room floor for no good reason whatsoever.The real catastrophe of this cut - aside of the shameless rape of one of my favorite childhood movies - is that there was no raw footage from which to assemble a new version . The Joneses had only a print of the original theatrical release to work with , thus they were only able to take parts out and shuffle them around rather than adding anything new . The result is that the entire first act is a chaotic muddle , the second act in Hy-Brasil feels overlong , and the Asgard sequence is a horribly rushed anticlimax with none of the impact of the original scene.I 'm completely mystified as to why this cut was made in the first place ( let alone a cut by such an incredibly untalented editor as Jones ) , but I could accept it if they 'd packaged the original version of the film with it .

I am warning anyone interested in seeing this movie to stay away , just do n't cause you 'll be mad .\",\n",
       " 'This cult classic / rarely seen Caadian television opus is now avaliable on video . This tape contains the two episodes of the series . First up is & quot ; Voyage of Discovery & quot ; - by Cordwainer Bird AKA Harlan Ellison . The pilot for this series was written by the popular fantasy author . Not only did he write the show he created the concept . at least until it went from a big budget show filmed in Hollywood to a low budget show videotaped in Canada . In the pilot we are introduced to a society of farmers living off the land in Cypress Corners . Cypress Corners happens to be inside a dome on a giant spaceship , but our main characters do not know that yet . Right away we meet Devon ( a bit of a questioning rebel ) who is not in favor with the elders of the community . he is deeply in love with Rachel . Unfortunately she is to be married to Garth , a local blacksmith with a promising future . Devon eventualy find out they are living in a sealed off dome , one of many aboard a jiant space ship . Later he and Rachel flee into the fast interior of the spaceship . They are pursued and then joined by Garth . the embark on a quest to save the Earthsip Ark as the bridge crew have been killed in an accident and the Ark is drifting out of control towards a star . Keir Dullea , best known for his role in 2001 , was cast in the leading role . & quot ; The Goddess Calabra & quot ; by Martin Lager ( From a Story by Ursula K. Le Guin ) Finds out heroes in a strangely Romanesque society inhabited only by men . Rachel does not fit in all that well but she happens to look just like the image of thier goddess ! Great fun and some interesting revelations about the ark and the posibility of our three heroes ever being able to repair it.This episode features John Colicos the actor who played Baltar on Battelstar Galactica and Bary Morrse the actor who played the scientist in the first season of Space : 1999 . Unlike most movie compilations of recent years the Starlost has not been hacked and slashed together to try to make it look like a movie . So what you get are the two episodes back to back minus the nice credit sequences .',\n",
       " \"I read the book before I saw the movie . I am a committed , and devout catholic Christian also , but I never read the book or saw the movie as anything more than exciting fiction ... I think all the bashing and alarmismfrom the religious right was `` overblown by the media and many in the Christian community who gladly mined the book and movie themselves for profits ... ( witness all the `` anti-DaVinci '' books , movies and audio tapes . ) If you are SECURE in your faith the book and film should not affect you.It did n't for me ... it actually led me to read more of the Bible and the patristic fathers of the Church . As for the film , well , the book was probably one of the `` best '' I 've ever read . I expected to be disappointed by the movie , but `` was not '' .I thought Tom Hanks and the Cast were GREAT . Do n't miss it ! Unless of course , you feel it is offensive ... As thinking adults we can and should all decide that for ourselves . Atreides\",\n",
       " \"Length : : 1:43 MinsIf you have , like me , wasted money on this current commercial release you will understand why people are so angry about this dvd.I have many 'home recorded ' films but always prefer to buy a commercial release dvd if there is one , this purchase has left me wondering why i did so on this occasion.I have attached a set of movie clips from my own personal recording ( digital TV ) you will see that it is far better than this current commercial release ! ! Raid On Entebbe is a superb Film ! that goes without saying . Having decided to obtain a 'commercial release ' of Raid On Entebbe I was totally disgusted with the quality of the Region 1 ( ntsc ) issue that i ordered from a company based in the USA . I author and produce DVDs as a small concern and sell to collectors on ebay and ioffer etc and could not believe that a large company could issue a DVD produced to the low standard that the DVD was that i received . The picture is dark and grainy , the quality is so poor the film is totally ruined , and thats apart from losing several minutes from the original film ! The DVD case has what i would describe as low grade artwork , i can live with that if the film itself is good quality but neither the film or artwork are good.I ordered a second DVD from another supplier as the cover design was different and expected a better copy but to no avail , that was rubbish also . I have an excellent quality print of Raid On Entebbe which i obtained some time ago , a home TV broadcast digital recording , the print i have is sharp and the colours true . I in fact took screen stills from both my print and the commercial issue and compared the same pictures side by side , and could not believe the difference i was seing , not only that but the sound quality was much lower on the 'official ' release . I author and supply many DVDs to collectors worldwide and produce artwork for all my DVDs so know whats involved , I would regard the official release DVD disc as no better than a coffee cup coaster . Raid on Entebbe however is not the only release to suffer low quality reproduction , it seems the major companies are also churning out some of the older films using very low quality film prints , i have better quality that i recorded 20 years ago on vhs than what some are putting out for sale . I used to believe that a DVD issued by a major DVD company was going to be the best quality available , sadly this is not the case these days . I have hundreds of home recordings which i will keep watching and save money in the meantime if companies keep putting out low quality dvds such as Raid On Entebbe .\",\n",
       " \"Overall , I like this . Evanescence gave an outstanding performance ( although some songs sounded a little alike ) , and I was surprised at good they sounded live . Also included are the band 's music videos to date , which are worth checking out if you have n't seen them before . The `` insightful '' behind-the-scenes segment offers a personal look at the band , revealing a free-spirited ( although sometimes silly ) side that one would not expect when considering the content of their music.That said , this package is still far from perfect . My cheif complaint was the videography itself . There are lots of unnecessary special effects edited into the performances , and the cameras switch so often and so quickly that it actually makes the show uncomfortable to watch at times . Also , the CD track listing is incorrect , and this could potentially cause some problems when trying to copy songs from the CD.Because of those complaints , I would recommend this primarily for Evanescence fans , especially those who have never seen them play live . For everyone else , I suggest checking out the `` Fallen '' album first .\",\n",
       " \"This is a great instructional DVD for ballet beginners who want to practice at home and improve their techniques . The teacher , Finis Jhung , is an innovative ballet instructor who has been teaching ballet in New York City since 1972 . He gives you concepts , ideas and imagery to work with , which are not commonly used in conventional ballet schools . Even the way he teaches you to use the barre and to work with your placement is different from run-of-the-mill instructions . It is so inspiring.I originally bought the Level 2 ( Advanced Beginners ) DVDs because I have been learning ballet as an adult for about a year and a half . But I realized that Jhung has his very own method and I was curious to learn about the basics in order to build a sold foundation as I progress . I do n't regret a bit about having purchased the Level 1 Barre DVD . Just the first few exercises are worth more than the money you pay for it . In fact , this is almost as good as a private ballet teacher , except you would want to have a mirror to give yourself corrections . It is important to have a home-practice barre and mirror or access to a ballet studio when you use Finis Jhung 's DVDs . Another good thing about the DVD is that the demonstrations show exercises for both left and right sides , so you do n't have to keep on rewinding the disc to repeat the other side . The demonstrator is excellent and shows the movements slowly and beautifully -- she is n't only someone whom adult beginners can look up to , but someone whom they can relate to as well.One word about the music . I did n't like the music in the Level 2 DVDs at all , as the rhythms are really odd and the melodies very ugly . But the music in the Level 1 DVD ( composed by the same guy Scott Killian ) is quite acceptable.I highly recommend this DVD to any adult ballet students who want to get a solid grip on their basic techniques , as this will greatly help them build more advanced techniques in the future.While Finis Jhung 's DVDs are pricier than other ballet instruction videos ( which I own quite a few ) , his are definitely more worth every dollar that you pay for , because you get so much out of them .\",\n",

       " \"& quot ; Pandaemonium & quot ; is truly a tribute to two of the great geniuses of English Literature -- Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth .

It does n't pull punches with the opium addiction and Coleridge 's usually cold marriage to his wife Sarah . Lord Byron makes a cameo . I was slightly disappointed that there was no room for introducing Asra -- Mary Wordsworth 's sister and Coleridge 's obsession -- but that side story does n't detract from the overall experience .

       " \"I suppose it makes perfect sense that if you want to make a 19th-century English romance novel into a superb film you hire an actress almost twice the age of the main character to not only play the role but also adapt the screenplay into a book and then hire a Taiwanese director to direct the film . You might say , yes , such things happen in Hollywood , but the success of `` Sense and Sensibility '' is due to what transpired in England , not Southern California . Having read the novel and the original screenplay , the largest share of credit goes to Emma Thompson , who deservedly received the Oscar for Best Screenplay Adaptation . Thompson began by dramatizing every scene in the novel , which resulted in 300 hand written pages to be followed by 14 drafts as the 1811 novel was crafted into the final script . The result was a script that manages to be not only romantic and funny , but also romantic and funny in the best Austen sense of both.After watching the film again I focus on three particular points , which I think best reveal the strength of Thompson 's script . First , the entire introductory sequence , which induces us to like the Dashwood sisters because we are introduced first to their step-brother and his shrewish wife ( credit for this particular sequence also goes to Film Editor Tim Squyres , who recut the scene so that we get all of one side and then the other instead of alternating back and forth as in the original script ) . Our sympathies can not help but be with the plight of Elinor and Marianne . Second , the use of Shakespeare 's Sonnet 116 ( `` Let me not the marriage of true minds '' ) , which Marianne and Willoughby share to their great mutual delight ( except he gets a word wrong , in an elegant little bit of foreshadowing ) and which Marianne repeats standing in the rain looking at Willoughby 's new estate . Third , Austen has Elinor bolt from the room to cry outside during the happy ending but Thompson creates a wonderful moment by having her stay in the room and having the rest of her family flee . There are not too many scenes where you are crying and laughing at the same time , but Thompson certainly created one ( and has the added virtue of relying on herself as an actress to nail the performance as well ) . All of these are marvelous examples of playing to the strength of the cinema to bring Austen 's novel to the screen.The performances are first-rate , especially Kate Winslet as the passionate Marianne , Gemma Jones as Mrs. Dashwood and Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon ( the look on his face when Marianne thanks him for rescuing her is so wondrously touching ) . Hugh Grant does find a way of slowing the delivery of his dialogue more than usual , but it does fit the overall pace of the film . The supporting cast is exactly what you come to expect from a British production with Elizabeth Spriggs stealing every scene she is in as Mrs. Jennings , Robert Hardy as Sir John Middleton , Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer , Oliver Ford Davies as Doctor Harris , and the enchanting young Emilie Francois as Margaret Dashwood ( `` They always kneel down '' ) . On the darker side of the ledger we have Greg Wise as the less than honorable John Willoughby , and Imogene Stubbs as Lucy Steele and Harriet Walter as Fanny Dashwood vying for the main villainess role in the proceedings . No wonder Emma Thompson 's performance as Elinor is almost lost in the proceedings , but she is the center around which everything resolves who has to keep it together when everybody around her is losing it ( even when she first confesses her broken heart , she ends up consoling Marianne instead of the other way around ) .Ang Lee had already proven he could handle a tale of sisters in love when he directed `` Eat Drink Man Woman . '' In `` Sense and Sensibility '' he has the script , the actors and the set design all working in his favor to create a sense of 19th century England . But there are a few moments when he uses the camera to great advantage ; in particular the overhead shot of Marianne on her sick bed achieves a painting like quality and the tracking shot of Mrs. Jennings running down the street bearing the latest gossip.I first saw this film when visiting England and I was so caught up in the story that I had no idea who was going to end up with who . Actually , I was sort of rooting for Elinor to end up with Colonel Brandon since they were obviously the two finest members of their respective sexes in the proceedings . So the ending was as much of a surprise to me as it was to the Dashwoods , which is certainly something to be cherished . Obviously if you love this film it will lead you to other Austen adaptations ( the film versions of `` Emma '' and `` Persuasion '' along with the BBC mini-series `` Pride & Prejudice '' immediately leap to mind ) , but hopefully it will also lead you to the original novels as well . Finally , Thompson published `` The Sense and Sensibility : Screenplay & Diaries , '' which I would highly recommend after you have done both the film and the novel .\",\n",

       " \"`` The Last Samarai '' is one of the greatest films released in 2003 , starring Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe . Its hardhitting impact is intense enough to keep audiences ' eyes wide open through the whole movie . Its written plot of a US soldier changing his life for the better in Japan is brilliant . Despite the war themes , there are some great heartwarming scenes , namely when the US soldier starts healing his pains from his US war battles . As he begins learning Japanese traditions , he begins learning more about himself , which plays a crutial part in the film . As this develops , the drama also develops , which keeps audiences interested . This allows the conflicts between the two sides to be brought out as brilliantly as it was . His friends ' life stories add an additional unique flavor . The war scenes are uniquely intense . Few other movies have thought of such original war scenery . This teaches audiences that there is no one way to fight a war or to solve a conflict . Its Oscar-nominated 1870 's Japanese setting is flawless . They prove that they did their research to construct such an elaborate set . The war scenes are desplicted as brutal as they should thanks to the special effects . The costumes are accurate from those times . Such great background offers an improved sense of this masterpiece film.Tom Cruise 's underrated role as US soldier Nathan Algren is his best in years . His two years of training to prepare for his role paid off . He never loses his intense sense of emotion for a second . The pain and agony expressed are as pure as if he actually lived it . Ken Watanabe 's Oscar-nominated role as Samarai leader Katsumoto rightfully places him in the spotlight . This performance makes acting appear easy when it 's actually the opposite . He proves that he will become a big-name actor in the next following years . All other actors also performed their roles beautifully . `` The Last Samarai '' is great for those looking for a unique war movie with emotion . This is sure to please many audiences . This is destined to be a classic in the following years as it deserves .\",\n",
       " \"I first saw this movie over 20 years ago and did n't like it because I did n't like any of the characters . Flashforward two decades and I now like at least six of them . That tells you the way time builds human understanding . As a kid I assumed that the world was a good place , but now I know it to be equal parts good and evil . Few films showcase this eventuality more artfully and powerfully than the Road Warrior . This is an amazing production and I truly envy you if you 've never seen it before.The Road Warrior is both entertaining and deeply enlightening . There is more truth in its portrayal of human nature than a million self-help books and a hundred Hollywood movies . Civilization 's veneer is thin . Without police and a government we would revert to shameful behaviors and attempt to survive by any means necessary . Max and the Gyro Captain are great but I still think that the feral boy character steals the spotlight from everyone else .

The 1960 version did not dare to touch upon the deep morality of the book , nor the fact that Ari Ben Canaan was an unsympathetic hero . Mark Parker was greatly reduced , Dov Landau turned into a cross-section of Holocaustic horror , and Karen Hansen Clement ( by far the book 's most compelling personality ) was glossed over by a platinum blonde with far too few lines to be of interest . Dov Landau 's redemption through the arc of Exodus the novel was a tremendous story in and of itself , and perhaps there is too big a story to be made into film ... but I pray that it can be done . Only one major plot was followed once the boat gets to Palestine ( Kitty and Ari ) , and without the other vibrant relationships to color the story , the power is lessened . None of Uris ' Thucydidean talents were represented by the limited scope of this version . There are great and terrible issues in Uris ' book , and they were not done justice in this film , I urge you all to read the book .

       " \"A powerful story and a great cinematic experience , Metzger was at the top of his game in Camille 2000 . But this movie goes deeper than most on this topic.You probably already know the story line -- a beautiful `` jet setter '' bought and paid for by a very rich count hosts frequent parties dedicated to the hedonism she so passionately pursues . She meets a man and they fall in love for a summer . Then the romance ends unexpectedly . The next few weeks and months are a predictable series of chance meetings at various parties where the couple attempt to be unaffected by the other while doing things to intentionally hurt each other . It seems the couple themselves are the only ones who can not see the clear and obvious love still smoldering between them.But this story goes much deeper than a simple summer romance about love won and then lost . All through the movie it is clear that this large cast of `` the beautiful people '' is nothing more than a group searching for real meaning in their lives and not finding it , resulting in the predictable substitution of physical pleasure for real meaning . We have all done it on some scale - not finding what we truly want so we settle for what we think we want or for what we believe is the best we will find . And history suggests that sensuality is the most effective substitute for real meaning.As for all of us , sensuality works for a while for our central couple . But the truth seeps in no matter how badly we want it to stay out . It seems that the love our central couple feels for each other can not withstand the forces attacking it . Then hurt , anger , and even bitterness becomes their constant companions.Yet Metzger gives us so much more than this common and tragic story . He makes us long for the happiness our couple so deeply desires . He makes us want to step into the story , take them by the hand , and help them discover , perhaps again and again , the joy of unselfishly giving ourselves to another.This is a rich and powerful story of rich and powerful people seeking love and passion in a large and lavish context . The characters are the exaggerated caricatures we would expect in this type of story . Yet they seem so real and their conquests and pain become our conquests and pain so easily . I believe most of us will be able to identify with this couple entirely too well.And while this movie is all about sensuality , the nudity and sex are more subtle than obvious . The women 's outfits are ingeniously revealing but give the hint of nudity rather than the reality of it . There are a number of breasts in the film , and they are very beautiful breasts , but this is clearly not a skin-flick . If you are looking for porn , hardcore or even softcore , you need to keep looking.But if you do n't mind a little nudity in a story so poignant , then this will be a great addition to your library .\",\n",
       " \"Even if you do not like Disney 's post- & quot ; Lion King & quot ; attempts , you still have to give the studio credit for making each movie so diverse from each other . & quot ; The Emperor 's New Groove & quot ; , is without a doubt the most comical of Disney 's movies . Odd thing is , that if you were n't to see the & quot ; Walt Disney Pictures & quot ; intro , you would'nt know it was Disney . This is becuase & quot ; New Groove & quot ; departs in both animation & amp ; story-telling styles that has been Disney 's trademark . This film is narrated by the film 's main character , Emperor Kuzco , and has more of a fast pace Saturday morning cartoon feel to it ( that 's not a bad thing , BTW ) .In the story of trying to destroy the emperor but instead turning him into a Llama , the villains once again steal the show . However , unlike & quot ; Hercules & quot ; , the good guys are characters you like and care about . It 's just that Yzma ( probably the most outragoeus of all the Disney villains ) and Kronk have all the qualities of live action comedian , including timeing and style that makes you want to laugh . Kuzco and Pacha , have funny moments to , but some of them are forced.The DTS 5.1 track on the DVD is awesome , and the digital-to-digital transfer is flawless.It is a whole lot more comedic than & quot ; Aladdin & quot ; , but it 's not the same type of movie . & quot ; Aladdin & quot ; has comedic releif , in an otherwise serious adventure tale . While , & quot ; The Emperor 's New Groove & quot ; has some dramatic relief in an otherwise hysterical adventure tale . Great submission from Disney !\",\n",

Sadly , the youthful members of this cast did not go on to achieve the notoriety of Ethan Hawkes or Mel Gibson , but they are indelibly captured for all time like a fine sepia tone photograph you might find in your grandmother 's attic .

       " \"Do n't set yourself up for disappointment . Stargate SG-1 's Ark of Truth is rather pedestrian . The writer/director just did n't come up to par.This does n't mean that if you are a Stargate SG-1 fan that you should n't manfully suffer through it , if only to see Christopher Judge 's Teal'c explain a personal Truth to Vala 's Ori devotee husband.When the first Star Trek movie came out , all of us fans went to see it . It was great fun seeing our favorite characters again -- Captain Kirk , Spock , Dr. McCoy , Uhura , Sulu , Scotty -- even if the story plot was mostly derivative from earlier TV episodes and some was plain boring . And then there was the great new special effect of the Enterprise going into warp drive and the great new music.But this movie does n't even have the characters we came to love in the early Stargate SG-1 seasons . Richard Dean Anderson 's fabulous Colonel Jack O'Neill is replaced by a couple refugees from Farscape -- Ben Browder and Claudia Black , and Amanda Tapping 's Captain ( later Major ) Carter is turned into a Kewpie doll.Worst of all , Teal'c is called `` Muscles '' by Vala and not made to regret it . Michael Shank 's Daniel Jackson did reasonably okay ; but it was an ego choice , not a good character realization choice to stop wearing the glasses . I could have forgiven all this if only we 'd had one cameo of General Jack O'Neill.Forget special effects . Also pedestrian . Plus the director did n't seem to know how to make the transition from small to large screen . Too often his choices for acting and camera angles and dramatic close ups are stilted TV screen fare , not smoothly inconspicuous as in a good movie.BUT , without us supporting Star Trek : The Movie , there would n't have been Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan , which was really great science fiction movie story writing and acting . Nor would there have been Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home , which was such a lot of fun.So , buy this anemic movie and pray that the next one redeems it , and that hopefully someone who understood the magic of the first 4 seasons ( before the French bought the series and began ruining it ) is brought in to do the writing and someone with some imagination and originality collaborates.Stargate - The Ark of Truth\",\n",

It may be long , and not exactly fast paced , but it is a very well made movie from every comment I 've come across.Second , and this is the most important part as related to the DVD , the transfer and mastering job that Image did on this release is terrible . It 's non-anamorphic , and non-progressive ( so the interlaced scan lines are prominently seen when there is motion on screen ) . There are other gripes about the transfer as well , but those two are the big ones.Ten years after the release of this DVD it 's time for a Special Edition - with a reworked anamorphic , progressive transfer . Whether Image does it themselves , or they sell the rights to someone else ( or just let them lapse so Criterion can pick them up ) , this movie deserves MUCH better treatment than it got here.I 'll buy it as soon as a better DVD is released .\",\n",

Unfortunately I can not say the same for `` Bloodrayne '' which is neither scary nor campy . What I did n't like the most about this turkey of a movie was the way it edited . There was no real beginning . Everything the viewer learns about Rayne ( Kristanna Loken ) is through a series of annoying flashbacks . I can not believe that Oscar winner Ben Kingsley was tied to this awful film at least `` Species '' was actually scary , disgusting , yet entertaining . `` Bloodrayne '' is neither . Up until now I never thought a love scene could be so hilarious ( unintentionally ) until I saw Rayne and Sebastian get it on . It was so bad that it was funny . Although the two Underworld films really do n't offer anything substantially at least those films were entertaining , `` Bloodrayne '' was not . Bad acting , bad writing , bad everything . Apparently Hollywood has not learned from past disasters that video games do not make for good films ( i.e `` Super Mario Bros. '' and the `` Mortal Kombat '' films ) .\",\n",

Combining stylish , nightmarish imagery with a plot straight from the fetid imagination of English writer Clive Barker it succeeds where so many failed and is a genuine edge-of-the-seat watch . The introduction of the wholely evil Cenobites , led by the charismatic and ruthlessly sadistic Pinhead , was to shape many an imagination and even today the image of a white-faced bald-headed guy whose head is full of builder 's nails embodies the best ( worst ? ) of on-screen horror .

Like the other Stanley Kubrick DVDs in this white-box series , this Full Metal Jacket is pretty much a VHS dub of the movie - only thrown together onto a DVD . I 'm suprised that it 's not double sided like the original commercial DVDs were . Given the advances in DVD technology when this disk was released there was no need to sell such a lackluster product , besides trying to get as many Stanley Kubrick movies as possible into one big boxed set before Christmas of 1999 . This movie , The Shining , and to a lesser extent , A Clockwork Orange all suffer from this same exceedingly poor DVD treatment.Hopefully soon this movie will be re-released in a better DVD package , much like Goodfellas or The Shining needs .

       " \"I first saw & quot ; Lost Highway & quot ; about 3 years ago when it hit video , and thought it was a good if not great effort by famed weirdo director David Lynch . On the whole , I enjoyed the warped logic of the story , the eclectic cast of characters , and the sudden conclusion . On the techincal end , I thought the picture ( presented in full-screen format ) was fuzzy and murky , and often distracted from the film ; that , and the soundtrack ( with contributions from Angelo Badalamenti and Trent Reznor ) felt underused.Well , recently I purchased the letterboxed version of & quot ; Lost Highway , & quot ; and was amazed at how much better the movie seemed watching through that squashed rectangle of screen . The picture actually seemed to be remastered a bit from the original video print ( the fuzziness is mostly gone ) , and for some reason the movie did n't flow as clunkily as it had the other times I viewed it.Lynch is an undeniably talented director , but if you rent ( or buy ) & quot ; Lost Highway & quot ; based upon his reputation alone , you might be disappointed . The dream-like story ( about a jazz saxophonist who may or may not have killed his wife , is put in prison , and mysteriously morphs into a young mechanic with mob links ) lacks the smooth flow of events that was present in Lynch 's excellent & quot ; Blue Velvet. & quot ; What 's most distracting are the meaningless , drawn-out sex scenes that seem to come one after another in the second act ; either Lynch really loved seeing Patricia Arquette naked , or he wanted to see how far he could push the movie 's R rating.All in all , & quot ; Lost Highway & quot ; -- even with its noticeable flaws -- is better than most of the films mainstream Hollywood puts out . Even if you do n't like it , it will be hard not to claim this film is a good conversation piece .\",\n",

       " \"and you 'll think this is a better-than-average made-for-TV ( even though it was n't ) movie , and you 'll appreciate the book even more.Let 's start with the cons : The book was set in the late 1950 's ( around 1957 , I think , and I know I 'm comparing to the book , but bear with me ) , whereas the movie is set in present-day . This presents many problems.Just an aside : `` A Walk to Remember '' by Nicholas Sparks was set in 1958 and when it was translated to the screen , it lost a lot of its charm because it was set in the present . There 's just a certain charm about time past that can not be duplicated in the here and now.Anyway , fast-forwarding the book about thirty years , it lost something . The children would have been much more innocent , but then again , Jeb Stuart Adams and Kristy Swanson were MUCH too old for the roles . I know they were supposed to be older going into the attic than they were in the book ( I am guessing Chris and Cathy are the same age going into the attic in the movie as they were coming out in the book ) , but Jeb Adams was twenty-seven , and he looked it . And am I the only one who noticed the children more resembled displaced Amish children ( Chris wears suspenders and what was with Cathy and those dowdy dresses ? ) than the Dresden dolls they were supposed to be ? These children did not look Aryan enough -- yes , they had blond ( e ) hair , though I did n't notice any blue eyes , and Cory 's curly hair made him look Jewish ( which would have been fine , if this was a story about Jewish children , but it was n't ) , neither were any of these children stunning ; they were all rather ordinary looking ( Kristy Swanson was somewhat pretty , at least before her hair got chopped off ) . Though Victoria Tennant is elegant and attractive ( but not as ) in a Grace Kelly sort of way , she looked a bit tired . As for the father , well , I imagined a much handsomer man ( think Jeffrey Hunter with blond hair ) , but oh , well.But it was the children 's ages that were worse . The twins were fine , but Chris and Cathy were post-pubescent in the movie , as opposed to pre-pubescent in the book ( though Chris is fourteen in the book , he does n't start growing hair in certain places until later ) , which explains why the children in the book held out for as long as they did before escaping . It is much easier to control a fourteen-year-old boy than a boy old enough to serve in the military.I think the worst scene of the film was when Chris and Cathy are on the bus in the daytime and Cathy is going on about how they never had a pet , about how they should have had one so they could get used to death , or some such nonsense as that , so that she would know that fathers die , even handsome , wonderful ones , too . It was so totally pointless.I also think the fact that they arrived at Foxworth Hall during the daytime and through the front door instead of in the dark of night through the back deflated some of the mystery . The cinematography could have been darker in some places , lighter in others . Instead , it always seemed like it had just rained.We are given just a glimpse of what life was like , how sunny yellow it was , before Chris Sr. 's death.I did n't really mind the ending with Corinne dying , being hung by her wedding veil , because I really do see a book and a movie made from it as two separate works of art . That 's how Margaret Mitchell felt about `` Gone with the Wind '' . Though I read somewhere a sequel was planned , I am not sure how they would have went about doing that as `` Petals on the Wind '' focused not only on Cathy 's exciting and versatile love life , but on getting revenge on her mother.Cathy 's character was just totally different in the movie ( and so was Carrie 's -- Carrie was a little spitfire in the book ) and in leaving out the incest between Chris and Cathy , it lost something . Chris was just blah and Cory was cute and all , but not much else . The female characters dominated this film.Overall , the movie was just a low-budget , lackluster production.Now for the pros : The haunting , chilling score ( I 'm still not sure how I feel about Cathy 's narrating ) , and Louise Fletcher was perfect as the grandmother . This flick is entertaining enough because when I watched it before I even knew of the book 's existence , I was intrigued . I 've watched it twice since then and have the same opinion I 've had since reading the book -- that it could have been so much better , but better had it not been done at all . What 's in my imagination is better than anything they can put on film . I 've found the best movies are made out of bad books.Watch it once or twice , maybe even a third time with a friend , but that 's about it . The book has much more readability .\",\n",

When it comes time for his release he realises that perhaps the modern way is no longer his to follow.That pretty much sums up the basic storyline of The Last Samurai and while it can be compared with Dances With Wolves , it is more action filled.The fight scenes are superb and the battle scenes will have you on the edge of the couch.The characters are believable and throughout the movie you will form attachments to them.Cruise is at his best , while Ken Watanabe is sensational as the samurai fighting for his country 's traditions and values . Timothy Spall also plays a wonderful role as a former British diplomat turned photographer.The Last Samurai is excellent viewing and will appeal to those who like beautiful photography , a good storyline and terrific battle scenes .\",\n",

Also , kudo 's should go to the cinematography which , showing New York , in all four seasons , especially fall , is visually stunning . An absolutely beautiful film to watch ! The dialogue is extremely funny , not too clever ( thank-you ) , and above all , at times , insightful in what it has to say about relationships and how we go about this sometimes horrible ritual called dating.I know of no other movie that can make me laugh so hard at one moment and shake my head with wonder as one of the characters state something so honest , real and emotionally true that I almost cry . I may be overstating my case here but if so , than oh so slightly ! In the end , a film that I care for deeply because I care so much for the characters and one that I never tire of watching .

The series only covers the history of U.S aviation , exempting of course the topics listed above .

He does n't impress I mean , I think many actors could have did his role easily and just as well unforunately . The rest of the cast was pretty average too ... I do n't know they failed to keep the story interesting all of them.That was n't the only problem either . The biggest to me was the action . I do n't know but throughout the entire movie I grew very tired of all the ways the movie was trying to impress me with the very heavy action scenes . I think it all was a bit much after awhile , and unnecessary even in some parts of the film . I think Tom Cruise needs to learn a little does a lot . That 's my view on it . Some others may just love all of that but I did n't . Those sort of scenes ended up leaving me very bored and even fast forwarding in some parts.The entire movie lost me quickly .

       " \"Bloodrayne ( Uwe Boll , 2005 ) Every once in a while you run across a director of truly bad movies , but every time he takes on a project , he does something that , despite your knowing the movie is going to be even worse than the last godawful piece of crap he released , still makes you want to see it.In this case , Uwe Boll , responsible for such execrable movies as Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead , somehow managed to rope in a cast it 's quite hard to believe were willing to take a chance on a videogame-based Uwe Boll movie . Topping the list of `` what were they thinking ? '' actors here is Ben Kingsley . Can you believe this guy played Gandhi ? Michael Madsen ( Reservoir Dogs ) , Billy Zane ( Posse ) , Michelle Rodriguez ( Girlfight ) , Udo Kier ( Suspiria ) , and a number of others come along for the ride as well . I ca n't believe all of them were that strapped for cash . All of them are billed under TV actress Kristianna Loken ( who last saw the big screen while playing the bad boss monster in Terminator 3 ) , in the movie 's title role , a half-vampire half-human who 's out to kill Kingsley 's character , Kagan , because Kagan killed Rayne 's mother . The fact that he 's also her father does n't seem to make her question her motivation much . Not that anyone in this movie has enough of a character to really have much motivation.That does n't seem to bother Boll , who cuts this movie from exactly the same cloth as his others : lots of action , hints of sex that might actually be interesting if he cared enough to explore those scenes , a useless script , camerawork that 's just this side of competent , and Boll 's somewhat impressive ability to wring the worst possible acting out of anyone he casts.And yet , despite all this , the most depressing thing about Bloodrayne is that the movie actually did well enough overseas ( predictably , it flopped like a nightmare in America , making two and a half million , well under one-fifth of its budget ) that Vivendi greenlighted Bloodrayne II . At least none of the original cast , including Loken , were hard up enough to sign on for what can not help but be another Boll monstrosity . ( zero )\",\n",

       " \"I have seen various reviews of this film adaptation of L. Ron Hubbarb 's sci-fi novel , Battlefield Earth , and from the notoriously negative reviews ; Richard Roeper , Roger Ebert , The Nostalgia Critic , the works , with numerous Razzie wins . When it became available to watch instantly on Netflix , I decided to see it out of curiosity 's sake yesterday . And as it turns out , the critics were right ! This is one of the worst , most god-awful science fiction movies of all time ! I will address the flaws as we go along . Here is the premise . In the year 2000 , the planet Earth was seized by aliens from the opposing planet Psychlo . They have enslaved humanity to search for gold . Sounds like Elementary School style fan fiction , does n't it ? 1,000 years later , a village tribesman Jonnie `` Goodboy '' Tyler ( Barry Pepper ) decides to leave the village to hunt for food and comes across another tribe , who were kidnapped by the Psychlos . Something you will notice very quickly about this movie is that 95 % of the camera shots are at an angle , which feels like the camera is sinking in quicksand . Jonnie then meets Security Chief Terl ( John Travolta in a role that obscures and wastes his talent ) and his partner-in-crime Ker ( Forest Whitaker ) who plot to train the humans in secret , buy their way off Earth , and keep the gold for themselves , despite being really stupid and hardly know anything about humans . They do n't know what we eat , how we live , or our language . No joke . The language system can get pretty confusing at times . The Psychlos can sometimes appear to speak our language , when at others they actually use their native speech in a human 's perspective . I think this is so we wo n't read as many subtitles if you are lazy and just want to watch the movie , but they sometimes have the subtitles anyway . Why not just do a better job at keeping the languages separate . I can make do with a little reading . When they use a machine to give Jonnie information about the Psychlos and teach them how to use weapons and space-pods , they do n't see this as a recipe for disaster . And they could already teach them their language ? Why did n't they do that before because you can talk to them and learn so much . They can get a little lazy as well . How do they monitor the humans when they mine ? A small camera pod flies over and takes a still picture every few hours . Why not just use a video camera to record footage instead of plain photos ? Jonnie comes up with a plan to take back the planet . He learns everything he can about human history , the idiotic aliens and their weakness . Within two weeks , they find Ft Knox and give some of its gold to Terl , while they learn how to arm weapons , build bombs , and how to fly fighter jets . While that is going on , Terl mingles with his real-life wife ( what the Nostalgia Critic and I mean is that she was played by Kelly Preston , John Travolta 's wife ) . Then , the humans launch a surprise attack at the Psychlo base . So that means that six jets were able to combat an alien army , but an entire military in the past were only able to put up a measly 9-minute fight ? The memory machine must have been a fatal disadvantage . By the way , just a random question , but how were the humans able to find fuel for the jets ? If 1,000 years went by without the jets being used , the gasoline would have been of no use and the jets would have been ruined . I guess the military drained the gas and stored it away for when the time is right . Convoluted , is n't it ? In a very jumbled climax , Jonnie confronts and defeats Terl by blowing his arm off . The human blow up the base and the Psychlos suffocate . I forgot to mention that the Psychlos ca n't breathe Earth 's atmosphere and the same can be said for the humans in Psychlo 's radioactive and flammable atmosphere . One of them also plans to beam a bomb to the Psychlo 's planet . The explosion would be small , but due to its air design , it wiped out the entire planet forever in the most idiotically simple of all world destructions . So let me get this straight , Psychlo has an atmosphere made of radiation has never had a single explosion ? If the humans learned about this before , then Psychlo would have been destroyed to begin with . How stupid could they get ? ! Terl and Ker survive of Earth , but face different fates . Terl is used as a hostage for other Psychlo colonies to rescue , while Ker has a change in heart and disses Terl to help the humans . One of the writers , J.D . Shapiro , wanted this movie to be dark and edgy , with a more interesting story and a far more serious tone . However , Franchise Pictures decided to dumb down on the source material in order to appeal to children . That ultimately failed . The acting was so ridiculous and plagued with corny dialogue . John Travolta was so over-the-top goofy that he would be better off as Jonnie instead of the bland Barry Pepper . Despite this , I think Forest Whitaker was the only actor who was at least trying . Think about it . Ker joins the humans in the end , Pepper wins the Worst Supporting Actor Razzie , while Whitaker only got a nomination , and he still had a career after this . The overuse of Dutch angles can get sickening and give you a neck cramp . The plot was really simple-minded , convoluted , and uninteresting and it has nothing to do with Scientology , logic , or reason . The alien race is one of the dumbest in film history . The visual effects are average as well , nothing special . It uses cheap CGI , the sets look grungy and depressing , and the Psychlo makeup looks so silly with long hair and claw-like nails . I can now see why see why it was hated by many critics I know , because it was so messed up . If any of the cast and crew read this review , I am so sorry all this had to happen . Thanks a lot , Franchise Pictures ! You ruined everything ! P.S . No copyright infringement is intended .\",\n",
       " \"Although Kino makes no boast about print quality on the box , its print of MARK OF ZORRO seems to be from an excellent 35 mm source . This film is the first , and many say the best , of Doug Fairbanks ' swashbucklers that he personally financed and produced during the 1920s . His subsequent films were more elaborate - he seemed to rival DeMille in epic production quality - but ZORRO is the most consistently energetic . Fairbanks remains in a class by himself as a superstar and he became a multi-millionaire by acting out his daydreams in films . That 's nice work if you can get it ! DON Q , SON OF ZORRO is almost as good but bogs down here and there in story complications . The print quality and contrast is not as good as ZORRO and I suspect that DON Q comes from a 16 mm . print . The five years between the two films show Fairbanks ' reputation as a producer having grown : DON Q looks as though it costs four times what MARK OF ZORRO cost . Jon Mirsalis ' piano score is very qood and he captures everything that silent film accompaniment should be : melodic and never intrusive . The bonus material is interesting but I wonder why KINO did n't include the five minutes or so of outtakes from DON Q that has been in circulation for years . The unidentified sound film excerpt of Fairbanks included with Orson Welles ' introduction is from the 1931 talkie , REACHING FOR THE MOON . Even in the excerpt , Fairbanks seems rather constrained by the dialogue chores . When he enters a room by vaulting through the window , he lands with a & quot ; thump , & quot ; showing why sound films would rob Fairbanks of the illusion of effortless agility so wonderfully masked in his silent films . Three chapters from his 1918 motivational book , Making Life Worthwhile , are included . Some say the book and others published during that time were ghostwritten for Fairbanks . In any event , I 've wondered why he had nothing to say to the public during the years of the Great Depression in the 1930s when people really needed a boost.I highly recommend this dvd as a superb example of energetic silent filmmaking and for the joy of experiencing the inimitable Doug Fairbanks personality .\",\n",
       " \"The title is somewhat misleading , because this lengthy documentary is about so much more than the Canterbury Tales . Indeed , it covers Chaucer 's life and career and the various literary works he produced , including the Canterbury Tales , but also Book of the Duchess , etc . It also provides a great deal of incidental information about life in the 14th-century , the politics , economic situation , the Black Plague , the 1381 Rising , etc . Terry Jones is not only a member of the Python group , but also a published scholar about the 14th century , including books about Chaucer 's pilgrim knight ( titled Chaucer 's Knight ) , and the politics near the end of Chaucer 's life ( Who Murdered Chaucer ? ) . He has participated in other documentaries about the period that are a bit more humorous and Python-esque , such as the delightful series , Medieval Lives . However , this foray is much more serious . The length would make it cumbersome to show in a single class period , but at the college level , it would be a useful adjunct , for viewing in the library , for students taking courses in Chaucer and other medieval literature .

       " \"This is one of my favorite movies . Michael J . Fox plays Marty McFly , who accidentally gets sent back in time from 1985 to 1955 in a time machine that also happens to be a DeLorean automobile . The problem is to get enough of an electrical charge to get back to 1985 , while leaving 1955 as it was . In the process , Marty meets his parents , jeopardizes their relationship , and risks his own existance . Marty McFly is the part Fox was born to play , but there are other great performances here , as well . Christopher Lloyd is excellent as & quot ; Doc & quot ; Brown , and Lea Thompson , Crispin Glover , and Thomas Wilson also help to make this a very entertaining movie . There is an extra attraction here for those of us who can remember the 1950 's , and some of the gags based on Fox 's out-of-time character are classic . Check out Marty playing & quot ; Johnnie B. Goode & quot ; as a bandmember holds up the phone so his & quot ; cousin & quot ; , Chuck Berry , can listen and learn . This is not the cleverest or most sophisticated comedy around , but it is definitely great fun . I 've watched it many times and expect to watch it many more .

If , on the other hand , you actually prefer to do a little research before you jump on any old bandwagon you may find this romantic MTV fluffery to be a waste of time . Let me be clear ; I agree with some ( but not all ) of what is proposed by the author . My objection is to what he presents as 'evidence ' and furthermore , what he chooses to present as significant to proving his theories . It 's all hyperbolic grasping at straws spoken in an authoritative manner so as to imply 'secret truths . ' It 's silly.I wish I had a nickle for every time the author uses the words `` supposedly '' and `` therefore '' . I 'd probably wind up with little more than a dollar , but there are constant instances of drawing conclusions and making declarations of his fervent beliefs as if they were statements of fact right on the heels of his stating that something is unknown or a mystery.A great example is his declaration of the meaning of `` Baphomet '' . Nobody knows what this word REALLY means . There are many theories . Just check out Wikipedia -- not the best source for information on these things , but they do address a few of the various proposed etymologies of the word . He simply chooses the most dramatic version ( ooooohhh backwards writing ! of an abbreviation yet ! Those crafty Templars/Gnostics/Rosicrusians/Illuminati/Masons/Republicans ! ) and presents it as a fact . Look , he may be right , but only by luck . In a court of law we could throw out his entire testimony based on all the circular reasoning and sloppy , incomplete research.So , the information presented is faulty and incomplete in crucial ways . I do n't know his books . If they 're are shoddy as the material presented here I would n't touch them with a ten-foot Caduceus Wand of the Kerux ! Now as to the production : I ca n't imagine what had someone make the stylistic choices that have been made here . Why all the loud Emo/Grunge/Metal intersperced with New-Agey-Enya-type-stuff ? Why is the music so loud ? Why all the ultra-slow-motion pans that go nowhere ? Why all the multiple images layered on top of each other so that you ca n't clearly see anything ? Why all the shots of some guy ( the author ? ? ) wandering around historical sites with his mouth slack ? WHY ALL THE OBFUSCATION AND DISTRACTION ? If you have truly valuable infomation would n't you want to present it in a concise straightforward manner ? or at least artfully ?

Stockard Channing ( who really shines in over-the-top roles ) is incomparable and a perfect match to Bette . Her best lines are second only to Bette 's conversations with God and her editor . Master of the stage , Nathan Lane , delivers his usual outstanding performance as the endearing , funny , supportive husband and handler of Bette 's wacky , exceedingly self-centered Susann . Bette and Nathan are like cream and sugar . David Hyde Pierce brings Niles ' charm and wonderful sensitivity to his character as Bette 's editor . John Cleese , always a very funny guy , does n't get nearly enough screen time or lines , but makes the very best of it anyway.So what if the bio was n't accurate , it never is .

It 's ironic that Laughton would be playing a character with such a grudge against Henry Fonda since the two also despised each other in real life ( stemming from a bad experience when Laughton had directed Fonda in & quot ; The Caine Mutiny Court Martial & quot ; on Broadway ) .

It also happens to be the final film of one of cinema 's most honered craftsmen , Sir David Lean , who is considered by many to be the greatest British director of all-time . This film may not be on the level of his other 70mm epics such as & quot ; Bridge on the River Kwai & quot ; and & quot ; Lawrence of Arabia & quot ; in terms of sweeping scope , but it more than holds its own . Produced in an era where apartheid in South Africa was the hot political issue , this film deals realistically with the occupation of the english in India . Not so much the political occupation , but how the two culture relate to each other through the eyes of the films two lead characters beautifully played by Judy Davis and Victor Banerjee . A film which does not give you the answers , but encourages you to draw your own conclusion in regards to the charcters ( espeically Davis ' Adela Quested ) motivations . Now how does the DVD look ? The transfer is beautiful , the best I 've ever seen this film presented since it opened back in Dec , 1984 . There are no distracting compression artifacts or nasty layer switches . The dolby stereo surround track is clear and ambient with no drop-outs , so a 5.1 upgrade would 've been unnecessary for this film . If you enjoy striking visuals and English literature brought to vivid life through film , Passage is a must-have . My highest recommendation .\",\n",

There were some excellent action sequences ( many incredibly unbelievable ) , especially in the last 20 minutes . Some of the comic interplay between Wesley and Woody was amusing , but far from their chemistry in `` Jump '' . J-Lo 's character served no purpose except to show a little skin . She slowed the pace down for the first hour of the movie , it seemed like watching it in slow motion . It could have been an excellent action-packed buddy film of the Lethal Weapon genre if only the writers offered us a decent script . Instead , we got disconnected plotting and a whole lot of far-fetched antics . And Robert Blake should have `` Virginia Baked '' tattooed on his forehead . And what was up with Cooper 's character ? It seemed like the writers of the script came up with an idea for a serial killer/robber plot , but then could n't figure out what to do with him and wrote him out of the film halfway through without any resolution for his motive or background . Instead , the writers might have just recently spent an evening watching `` The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 '' and switched tracks , so to speak , and said `` hey , this might be a good idea for that new Harrelson/J-Lo/Snipes film we have to provide a script for tomorrow .

I was interested in their names , but sadly the film is terribly boring , even though it runs less than 90 minutes.Gina Philips plays Karen , a young business woman who inherits a house in a remote place in the countryside , which might or might not be haunted . Near the house lives a caretaker played by Tom Sizemore , who might or might not be possessed by something evil . The premise is all too familiar , used recently in such films as `` The Amityville Horror , '' and with the right direction the film would be thrilling.But you will soon realize that there in no thrills of any kind , not even a surprise by sudden big sound , in `` Ring Around the Rosie '' which introduces many recycled bits of images seen in other thrillers - from rudimentary tricks like shadows moving behind the door , a weird reflection in the mirror , strange noise in the midnight or unreliable neighbor staring at the protagonist , to the heroine tormented by nightmares and her buried memories of the past.The film has also Karen 's amiable boyfriend ( Randall Batinkoff ) and her lovely younger sister ( Jenny Mollen ) . The former leaves the house while Karen stays to clean up the house ; the latter arrives there and what Karen sees and hears start to get stranger . Considering the nature of the conclusion and suggested history of Karen 's childhood ( which I can not disclose here ) , there could be some psychological explanations about the strange events that terrorize Karen , as in such thrillers as ` The Others . '' That 's what I thought while trying not to sleep , but no matter how I try , I can not find one in this disjointed story that is confusing and illogical . If you see a character falling from the window and another character catches her in his arms in a cartoon-like way , you realize this is not a very good psychological thriller.Or maybe I am thinking too much . Probably this is another badly written horror film you might find in your rental video shop , borrow it and regret it later .

It 's one of the films ( along with She , Island of Lost Souls , The Day the earth Stood Still , and a handfull of others ) that transformed science fiction films , from their undeserved status as kids ' stuff , to serious depictions of the human condition ... not to mention the alien condition , which is so often and unsettlingly similar to our own . And speaking of unsettling resemblances , have you ever noticed how much this film resembles Star Trek ? Ca n't be helped . There 's a certain & quot ; family resemblance & quot ; in a lot of s-f , and the ship/crew/new worlds gimmick was in use long before Captains Adams and Kirk appeared . Anyway , the producers of Forbidden Planet could hardly sue anyone for plagiarism , now could they ? The story is that of The Tempest ; though certain events have been changed and liberties taken , the core of Shakespeare 's play remains unchanged . Prospero ( i.e . Morbius ) guards his daughter and island-bound privacy jealously , and uses his magic to confuse and terroroize the party of sailors who 've landed there . It 's a small step from this to Altair-IV ; with the Krell to provide Morbius ' magic , Robby the Robot to act as both Caliban and Ariel , and some good old techno-huggermugger thrown in to help obfuscate things further , it 's a different ( but still similar ) story . It 's also a damned good story , a powerful depiction of a man destroyed by his darkest subconscous obsessions . It 's a story that demands to be taken seriously ... and in spite of such distractions as a drunken robot , not to mention the clumsiest seduction ever committed to celluloid , take it seriously we do . One of the most important reasons this film was taken seriously was its special effects . Many of them were , and still are , some of the best of their kind . Even by today 's advanced standards , a good deal of the visuals are real-looking and seamless . Watch the scene where Adams vaporizes the tiger ; it 's almost impossible to see the effects edit . And even though Altair is obviously a soundstage , the Krell constructions beneath Mobius ' home achieve complete reality . This feels like -- no , is -- an alien environment ... which leads to another great visual : Morbius , Adams and the Doc , walking on the gantry , infinitesimal specks against the massive Krell machinery all around them . And even the soundstage set has its moments -- when the monster gets caught in the force-field , and you get your first good look at its misshapen , demonic form , it 's an instant edge-of-your-seat moment . Whatever you were expecting , it sure was n't that ! As to the actors -- well , Walter Pidgeon pretty much carries the film , which is really only fair as his character is the key to everything . Anne Francis , who would later go on to immortality in a lyric from Rocky Horror Picture Show , is very good -- and absolutely gorgeous ! -- as sheltered ( but game ) daughter Vena . And Leslie Nielsen , a very funny guy who persists in doing unfunny movies , here does an admirable job with a role that was written to be one-dimensional . Nielsen somehow stretches J. J. Adams to two-and-a-half dimensions -- now that 's acting ! ( they 've given Oscars for less ! ) The supporting cast perform their various script-related functions ( hey , just like Star Trek ! ) , and do so very capably ... though I ca n't imagine why a tight-run ship like Adams ' would have an alcoholic cook -- or , for that matter , why such an advanced ship would even have an old-fashioned pots-n-pans kitchen in the first place . Oh , well ... even in spite of such obvious mistakes , Forbidden Planet is still a classic , a great film in any category , and will be loved by anybody who loves movies .\",\n",

As a result she ends up at odds with her friends and having to kill a load of others including the Blood Chinois , a group whose only function appears to be one scene as cannon fodder.After all this the film almost seems to run out of breath and in the few moments it pauses the film almost starts to work , we get some glimpses into who the boy Six is , why Violet does what she does and what 's going on . But then cast and crew get their second wind and the mad dash for the finish line is on.There is a slight twist to the end , but it 's not something you 'll care about and the bit with Violet and Six starting their happy ever after life style ending , despite both having been killed in the movie is twee and after all the slaughter that lead to it just plain silly , I suspect the input of some asinine focus group.Badly paced with a poor script and a director who seems to be trying to build on what he created in Equilibrium , but with remarkably little success . I really wanted to like this movie , despite the drubbing some other reviewers have given it , but I 'm afraid I do n't . On the plus side Mila as always looks incredible and some of the fight scenes are n't bad which earns it a few points .\",\n",
       " 'This movie really is a complete stinkpot.The acting is horrible , the action is way too over the top and unbeleivable , and the comedy is way too stupid and cheesy . First off the movie gets started in a crazy action scene/war flashback . No story what so ever . The car chase scene is so full of it , a car gets shot with a high powered rifle like 500 times and is still driving around . Even the twist at the end was completely easy to figure out . Please avoid this reeking exploding crock of ... .',\n",

       " \"Do yourself a favor and do not buy this DVD ! This movie has been recut horribly ! the edits make the movie move faster in a clumsy sloppy way . There was no need to re-edit the original , which was a fantastic movie ! One of my personal favorites.I hope there will be enough bad reviews of this DVD to prompt a re-release of ETV in it 's original format . Truely a bad idea on the part of Terry Jones .\"]"
